The parameters of the hybrid model are optimized by minimizing a novel loss function, which combines the mean square error (MSE) between controlled variables and their reconstructions from the LSTM-AE model, along with the MSE of manipulated variables and their reconstructions obtained with the numerically implemented and exactly a priori known controller equations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on the benchmark of an industrial-scale penicillin process as a batch case study and the Tennessee Eastman plant process under a decentralized control strategy as a continuous case study. A comparative analysis of the proposed hybrid model with an equivalent nonhybrid LSTM-AE model, which does not utilize process controllers' equations, highlights the superiority of the proposed hybrid monitoring model in fault detection. These improvements result from the use of an LSTM-AE network with fewer parameters, thus making it less susceptible to overfitting.},

As a novel solution to tackle this problem, we propose here a local subspace based outlier detection technique, which uses different subspaces for different objects. Using this concept we adopt local density based outlier detection to cope with high-dimensional data. A broad experimental evaluation shows that this approach yields results of significantly better quality than existing algorithms.},

This strategy is essential to provide credible reasoning on why and when an empirical versus hybrid (i.e., physics-supported) approach should be used and to determine the ideal mix of these two approaches for a defined anomaly detection scope. Empirical methods are usually based on pattern, statistical, and causal inference. Hybrid methods include the use of physics models to train and test data methods, reduce data dimensionality, reduce data-model complexity, augment data, and reduce empirical uncertainty; hybrid methods also include the use of data to tune physics models. The presented strategy is driven by key decision points related to data relevance, simple modeling feasibility, data inference, physics-modeling value, data dimensionality, physics knowledge, method of validation, performance, data availability, and suitability for training and testing, cause-effect, entropy inference, and model fitting. The strategy is demonstrated through a pilot use case for the application of anomaly detection to capture a valve packing leak at the high-pressure coolant injection system of a nuclear power plant.},

Despite the wide range of anomaly detection approaches, localization of detected anomalies in multivariate and Multisensor time-series data remains a challenge. Interpretation and anomaly attribution is critical and could improve the analysis and decision-making for many applications. With anomaly attribution, explanations can be leveraged to understand, on a per-anomaly basis, which sensors cause the root of anomaly and which features are the most important in causing an anomaly. To this end, we propose using saliency-based ExplainableAI approaches to localize the essential sensors responsible for anomalies in an unsupervised manner. While most Explainable AI methods are considered as interpreters of AI models, we show for the first time that Saliency Explainable AI can be utilized in Multi-sensor Anomaly localization applications. Our approach is demonstrated for localizing the detected anomalies in an unsupervised multi-sensor setup, and the experiments show promising results. We evaluate and compare different classes of saliency explainable AI approach on the Server Machine Data (SMD) Dataset and compared the results with the state-of-theart OmniAnomaly Localization approach. The results of our empirical analysis demonstrate a promising performance.},

Specifically, it points out the similarities, differences and potential pitfalls associated with cyclic spectral analysis as opposed to classical spectral analysis. It is shown that non-parametric cyclic spectral estimators can all be derived from a general quadratic form, which yields as particular cases ``cyclic'' versions of the smoothed, averaged, and multitaper periodograms. The performance of these estimators is investigated in detail on the basis of their frequency resolution, cyclic leakage, systematic and stochastic estimation errors. The results are then extended to more advanced spectral quantities such as the cyclic coherence function and the Wigner--Ville spectrum of CS signals. In particular an optimal estimator of the Wigner--Ville spectrum is found, with remarkable properties. Several examples of cyclic spectral analyses, with an emphasis on mechanical systems, are finally presented in order to illustrate the value of such a general treatment for practical applications.},

The benefits offered by the cyclostationary framework in Condition Monitoring have been explored since more than one decade; research in this domain has resulted in the proposal of a quite general methodology and processing tools to analyze mechanical signatures of machines. The state-of-theart in cyclostationarity, as it stood a few years ago, still faced a few strong limitations. The aim of this communication is to introduce recent solutions to these issues. First, the framework is generalized to angletime cyclostationarity, an enlarged class which perfectly models signals of machine operating under varying regime. Second, a fast estimator is proposed for the spectral correlation density, a central tool of cyclic spectral analysis. Finally, solutions are given for the synthesis and the extraction of a cyclostationary signal. This is briefly illustrated on vibration signals.},

The key idea consists in recognizing gear signals as purely periodic, whereas bearing signals experience some randomness and are close to cyclostationary, i.e. with a periodic bivariate autocorrelation function. This assertion is demonstrated by introducing a comprehensive model for the vibration generating process of bearing faults: distinctions are made between localized and distributed faults, between cyclostationary and pseudo-cyclostationary processes, and between additive and multiplicative interactions with gear signals. Finally, an original diagnostic procedure is proposed and its performance illustrated using simulated, experimental and actual cases.},

However, the complete exploration of the whole plane (f ; Df ) is a formidable task hardly amenable to on-line industrial applications. In this communication we describe a fast algorithm for computing the kurtogram over a grid that finely samples the (f ; Df ) plane. Its complexity is on the order of N log N, similarly to the FFT. The efficiency of the algorithm is then illustrated on several industrial cases concerned with the detection of incipient transient faults.},

The Cyclic Modulation Spectrum (the Fourier transform of the spectrogram) stands as a much faster alternative, yet it suffers from the uncertainty principle and is thus limited to detect relatively slow periodic modulations. This paper fixes the situation by proposing a new fast estimator of the spectral correlation, the Fast Spectral Correlation, based on the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). It proceeds from the property that, for a cyclostationary signal, the STFT evidences periodic flows of energy in and across its frequency bins. The Fourier transform of the interactions of the STFT coefficients then returns a quantity which scans the Spectral Correlation along its cyclic frequency axis. The gain in computational cost as compared to the conventional estimator is like the ratio of the signal length to the STFT window length and can therefore be considerable. The validity of the proposed estimator is demonstrated on non trivial vibration signals (very weak bearing signatures and speed varying cases) and its computational advantage is used to compute a new quantity, the Enhanced Envelope Spectrum.},

Typical approaches for their detection proceed in the time or frequency domains, with tools such as the spectral kurtosis, the kurtogram, or the envelope spectrum. The object of this paper is to extend and somehow connect these concepts in order to capture the signature of repetitive transients in both domains. Motivated by ideas borrowed from the field of thermodynamics where transients are seen as departures from a state of equilibrium, it is proposed to measure the negentropy of the squared envelope (SE) and of the squared envelope spectrum (SES) of the signal. This defines the SE infogram, the SES infogram, and their average which is theoretically maximum for a Dirac comb according to Hirschman's uncertainty principle. It is demonstrated that the joint consideration of the infograms significantly extends the domain of applicability of the kurtogram, in particular to situations corrupted with impulsive noise or when the relaxation time of the transients is low as compared to their rate of repetition. This is illustrated on both synthetic and actual vibration signals. This paper is part of a special issue in honor of Professor Simon Braun and pays tribute to his early contribution to the field of mechanical signature analysis.},

As such, it helpfully supplements the classical power spectral density, which as is well known, completely eradicates non-stationary information. In spite of being particularly suited to many detection problems, the SK had rarely been used before now, probably because it lacked a formal definition and a well-understood estimation procedure. The aim of this paper is to partly fill these gaps. We propose a formalisation of the SK by means of the Wold--Crame{\textasciiacute} r decomposition of ``conditionally non-stationary'' processes. This definition then engenders many useful properties enjoyed by the SK. In particular, we establish to which extent the SK is capable of detecting transients in the presence of strong additive noise by finding a closed-form relationship in terms of the noise-to-signal ratio. We finally propose a short-time Fourier-transform-based estimator of the SK which helps to link theoretical concepts with practical applications. This paper is also a prelude to a second paper where the SK is shown to find successful applications in vibration-based condition monitoring.},

  abstract = {Recent studies in the field of diagnostics and prognostics of machines have highlighted the key role played by non-stationarity -- often in the form of cyclostationarity -- or nonGaussianity -- often in the form of impulsiveness as characteristic symptoms of abnormality. Traditional diagnostic and prognostic indicators (e.g. the kurtosis) are however sensitive to both types of symptoms without being able to differentiate them. In an effort to investigate how the signal characteristics evolve with the different phases of machine components degradation, this paper proposes a new family of condition indicators able to track cyclostationary or non-Gaussian symptoms independently. A statistical methodology based on the maximum likelihood ratio is introduced as a general framework to design condition indicators. It arrives with the possibility of setting up statistical thresholds, as needed for a reliable diagnosis. The methodology is validated with numerically generated signals and applied to the dataset made available by NSF I/UCR Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS). This particular application shows high potential for bearing prognostics by providing condition indicators able to describe different phases of the bearing degradation process.},

The aim is essentially to provide a better understanding of the recognized ``envelope analysis'' technique as classically used in the diagnostics of rolling element bearings, and incidentally give theoretical proofs for the specific features of envelope spectra as obtained from experimental data. The proposed model may also prove useful for simulation purposes. First, the excitation force generated by a defect is modeled as a random point process and its spectral signature is derived analytically. Then its transmission through the bearing is investigated in detail in order to find the spectral characteristics of the resulting vibration signal. The analysis finally gives sound justification for ``squared'' envelope analysis and the type of spectral indicators that should be used with it.},

In this work, we propose a new anomaly detection method that operates by decomposing TCP traffic into control and data planes, which exhibit similar behaviors in the absence of attacks. The proposed method exploits the statistics of the cross-correlation function of the two planes traffic and the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) scheme for detecting anomalies of the underlying network traffic. Both the fixed and adaptive thresholding schemes are implemented. The adaptive thresholding is setup by adjusting the value of the threshold in accordance with the local statistics of the cross-correlation function of the two planes traffic. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method by analyzing the real traffic captured from a deployed network and traffic obtained from other publicly available datasets; we focus on TCP traffic with three different aggregated count features: packet count, IP address count, and port count sequences. Although both the fixed and adaptive thresholding schemes perform well and detect the presence of a distributed denial-ofservice efficiently. The adaptive thresholding scheme is more reliable because it detects anomalies as they start.},

The objective of making industrial operations monitoring easier also implied the usage of more effective data-driven predictive maintenance approaches, including those based on machine learning. Although those approaches are becoming increasingly popular, most of the traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms experience the following three major challenges: 1) lack of training data (especially faulty data), 2) incompatible computation power, and 3) discrepancy in data distribution. A new data-driven technique, such as transfer learning, can be developed to overcome the issues related to traditional machine learning and deep learning for predictive maintenance. Motivated by the recent big interest towards transfer learning within computer science and artificial intelligence, in this paper we provide a systematic literature review addressing related research with a focus on predictive maintenance. The review aims to define transfer learning in the context of predictive maintenance by introducing a specific taxonomy based on relevant perspectives. We also discuss current advances, challenges, open-source datasets, and future directions of transfer learning applications in predictive maintenance from both theoretical and practical viewpoints.},

  abstract = {In this work, we demonstrate how physical principles -- such as symmetries, invariances, and conservation laws -- can be integrated into the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). DMD is a widely-used data analysis technique that extracts low-rank modal structures and dynamics from high-dimensional measurements. However, DMD frequently produces models that are sensitive to noise, fail to generalize outside the training data, and violate basic physical laws. Our physics-informed DMD (piDMD) optimization, which may be formulated as a Procrustes problem, restricts the family of admissible models to a matrix manifold that respects the physical structure of the system. We focus on five fundamental physical principles -- conservation, self-adjointness, localization, causality, and shift-invariance -- and derive several closed-form solutions and efficient algorithms for the corresponding piDMD optimizations. With fewer degrees of freedom, piDMD models are less prone to overfitting, require less training data, and are often less computationally expensive to build than standard DMD models. We demonstrate piDMD on a range of challenging problems in the physical sciences, including energypreserving fluid flow, travelling-wave systems, the Schro{\textasciidieresis} dinger equation, solute advectiondiffusion, a system with causal dynamics, and three-dimensional transitional channel flow. In each case, piDMD significantly outperforms standard DMD in metrics such as spectral identification, state prediction, and estimation of optimal forcings and responses.},

We experiment with methods for training a harmless AI assistant through selfimprovement, without any human labels identifying harmful outputs. The only human oversight is provided through a list of rules or principles, and so we refer to the method as `Constitutional AI'. The process involves both a supervised learning and a reinforcement learning phase. In the supervised phase we sample from an initial model, then generate self-critiques and revisions, and then finetune the original model on revised responses. In the RL phase, we sample from the finetuned model, use a model to evaluate which of the two samples is better, and then train a preference model from this dataset of AI preferences. We then train with RL using the preference model as the reward signal, i.e. we use `RL from AI Feedback' (RLAIF). As a result we are able to train a harmless but nonevasive AI assistant that engages with harmful queries by explaining its objections to them. Both the SL and RL methods can leverage chain-of-thought style reasoning to improve the human-judged performance and transparency of AI decision making. These methods make it possible to control AI behavior more precisely and with far fewer human labels.},

In this paper, we propose a novel, unsupervised physics-informed model structured after expert knowledge in the form of a graphical representation of the expected relationships between sensor readings, operating conditions, and degradation. In addition, a soft constraint is used to guide the representation of the HI according to generally available expert knowledge about degradation. We evaluated the model on a turbofan engine dataset and conducted four experiments by manipulating the original data to create realistic real-world scenarios. The proposed method discovers an HI that exhibits better intrinsic qualities than the current state-of-the-art methodologies, leading to enhanced prognostic performance. Notably, in situations where the initial health state of each system varies, the proposed method achieves an average prognostic performance improvement of approximately 20\% compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.},

A second (mis)conception is that interpolation happens throughout tasks and datasets, in fact, many intuitions and theories rely on that assumption. We empirically and theoretically argue against those two points and demonstrate that on any high-dimensional ({$>$}100) dataset, interpolation almost surely never happens.

  abstract = {Latent variable models are important for condition monitoring as they learn, without any supervision, the healthy state of a physical asset as part of its latent manifold. This negates the need for labelled fault data and the application of supervised learning techniques. Latent variable models offer information from which health indicators can be derived for condition monitoring. Namely, information from the latent space and the data space can be used for condition inference. These health indicators are used to explain changes in a physical asset's condition. Conventional black-box approaches only offer information from the data space in the form of reconstruction errors. In contrast, latent variable models offer a latent space and reconstruction space for inference. However, the current application of latent variable models either disregards latent space information or fails to realise its full potential. The full potential can be realised by preserving the time information in the data. Therefore, we propose a model evaluation procedure that specifically preserves time in the latent health indicators. The procedure is generic and can be applied to any latent variable model as demonstrated for Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in this study. In general, as time information can be discarded or preserved for derived latent health indicators, this study advocates that health indicators that preserve time are more useful for condition monitoring than health indicators that discard time. In addition, it enables the interpretation of the learnt latent manifold dynamics and allows for alternative latent indicators to be developed and deployed for fault detection. The proposed temporal preservation model evaluation procedure is applied to three classes of latent variable models using two datasets. Three model-independent latent health indicators that preserve time are proposed and shown to be informative on all three classes of latent variable models for both datasets. The temporal preserving latent analysis procedure is demonstrated to be essential to derive more informative latent metrics from latent variable models.},

  abstract = {Sample complexity results from computational learning theory, when applied to neural network learning for pattern classification problems, suggest that for good generalization performance the number of training examples should grow at least linearly with the number of adjustable parameters in the network. Results in this paper show that if a large neural network is used for a pattern classification problem and the learning algorithm finds a network with small weights that has small squared error on the training patterns, then the generalization performance depends on the size of the weights rather than the number of weights. For example, consider a two-layer feedforward network of sigmoid units, in which the sum of the magnitudes of the weights associated with each unit is bounded by A and the input dimension is n. We show that the misclassification probability is no more than a certain error estimate (that is related to squared error on the training set) plus A/sup 3/ /spl radic/((log n)/m) (ignoring log A and log m factors), where m is the number of training patterns. This may explain the generalization performance of neural networks, particularly when the number of training examples is considerably smaller than the number of weights. It also supports heuristics (such as weight decay and early stopping) that attempt to keep the weights small during training. The proof techniques appear to be useful for the analysis of other pattern classifiers: when the input domain is a totally bounded metric space, we use the same approach to give upper bounds on misclassification probability for classifiers with decision boundaries that are far from the training examples.},

This deficiency is substantial enough that it is hard to compare pruning techniques to one another or determine how much progress the field has made over the past three decades. To address this situation, we identify issues with current practices, suggest concrete remedies, and introduce ShrinkBench, an open-source framework to facilitate standardized evaluations of pruning methods. We use ShrinkBench to compare various pruning techniques and show that its comprehensive evaluation can prevent common pitfalls when comparing pruning methods.},

  abstract = {The growth of structural damage reduces the stiffness which results in decrease in the natural frequency of a specimen (coupon) under random vibration. However, the identification of the natural frequency is not a trivial problem because the coupons are shaken in a random fashion in which many closely-spaced frequencies are involved. The signal may have other redundant frequencies involved which are close to the natural frequency. The simplest way t o identify the frequencies of multiple sinusoids is the Fourier transform spectral analysis. However, when the frequencies of interest. are closely spaced, the Fourier transform spectrum analysis fails to resolve these frequencies. In this paper these facts are shown for a rcal vibration signal. High resolut,ion frequency estimation approach, such as the forward-backward linear prediction (FBLP) method, is adopted here to identify all the prominent frequencies in a certain bandwidth. From the pfh order FBLP model, we estimate p positive frequencies. Among these p frequencies, the one that will decrease as the structure degenerates, is the natural frequency and is monitored in an on-line mode. An estimation of natural frequency and its prediction is made regularly (every one second) based on all available est,imated iiat ural frequencies once the structure enters the fatigue zone. The system is useful for on-line health monitoring of iiriy structure under random vibration. We have applied t,his system t o monitor several aluminum coupons of aircraft structure. The tests were performed at the Wright Research Lab and the software monitoring system was developed at Tennessee Sta.te University.},

  abstract = {Due to the high spectral resolution, anomaly detection from hyperspectral images provides a new way to locate potential targets in a scene, especially those targets that are spectrally different from the majority of the data set. Conventional Mahalanobis-distance-based anomaly detection methods depend on the background statistics to construct the anomaly detection metric. One of the main problems with these methods is that the Gaussian distribution assumption of the background may not be reasonable. Furthermore, these methods are also susceptible to contamination of the conventional background covariance matrix by anomaly pixels. This paper proposes a new anomaly detection method by effectively exploiting a robust anomaly degree metric for increasing the separability between anomaly pixels and other background pixels, using discriminative information. First, the manifold feature is used so as to divide the pixels into the potential anomaly part and the potential background part. This procedure is called discriminative information learning. A metric learning method is then performed to obtain the robust anomaly degree measurements. Experiments with three hyperspectral data sets reveal that the proposed method outperforms other current anomaly detection methods. The sensitivity of the method to several important parameters is also investigated.},

  abstract = {A generic framework for prognostics and health monitoring (PHM) which is rapidly deployable to heterogeneous fleets of assets would allow for the automation of predictive maintenance scheduling directly from operational data. Deep learning based PHM implementations provide part of the solution, but their main benefits are lost when predictions still rely on historical failure data and case-by-case feature engineering. We propose a solution to these challenges in the form of a Deep Digital Twin (DDT). The DDT is constructed from deep generative models which learn the distribution of healthy data directly from operational data at the beginning of an asset's life-cycle. As the DDT learns the distribution of healthy data it does not rely on historical failure data in order to produce an estimation of asset health. This article presents an overview of the DDT framework and investigates its performance on a number of datasets. Based on these investigations, it is demonstrated that the DDT is able to detect incipient faults, track asset degradation and differentiate between failure modes in both stationary and non-stationary operating conditions when trained on only healthy operating data.},

  abstract = {Diagnostics of rolling element bearings involves a combination of different techniques of signal enhancing and analysis. The most common procedure presents a first step of order tracking and synchronous averaging, able to remove the undesired components, synchronous with the shaft harmonics, from the signal, and a final step of envelope analysis to obtain the squared envelope spectrum. This indicator has been studied thoroughly, and statistically based criteria have been obtained, in order to identify damaged bearings. The statistical thresholds are valid only if all the deterministic components in the signal have been removed. Unfortunately, in various industrial applications, characterized by heterogeneous vibration sources, the first step of synchronous averaging is not sufficient to eliminate completely the deterministic components and an additional step of pre-whitening is needed before the envelope analysis. Different techniques have been proposed in the past with this aim: The most widely spread are linear prediction filters and spectral kurtosis. Recently, a new technique for prewhitening has been proposed, based on cepstral analysis: the so-called cepstrum prewhitening. Owing to its low computational requirements and its simplicity, it seems a good candidate to perform the intermediate pre-whitening step in an automatic damage recognition algorithm. In this paper, the effectiveness of the new technique will be tested on the data measured on a full-scale industrial bearing test-rig, able to reproduce the harsh conditions of operation. A benchmark comparison with the traditional prewhitening techniques will be made, as a final step for the verification of the potentiality of the cepstrum pre-whitening.},

  abstract = {Neural networks (NN) have generated extensive interest in the field of machine condition monitoring (MCM). Many applications are however adapting structures and approaches from fields where NNs are highly established (e.g., image classification). This is done despite many neural network layers presenting strong similarities to signal processing steps that are well established in MCM. This paper aims at providing a mathematical analysis of typical NN archi\- tectures and layers, with specific attention to similarities to common signal processing steps such as filtering, downsampling, and enveloping. The set of strong analogies between NN and tradi\- tional MCM tools enables this work to provide MCM-specific guidelines for the design and tuning of NN architectures for MCM-specific applications. Most MCM applications are often charac\- terised by periodic and cyclostationary signals, a situation not frequently encountered in many other NN applications. Hence, the Fourier-based explanation of the typical NN layers will be specific to the solution of typical MCM problems (e.g., diagnostics of gears and bearings). The study is aligned with the current trends of explainable AI and physics informed neural networks (PINN), in the sense that it aims at producing mathematical rules for a rational design of the network, drawing on the expertise accumulated in decades of signal processing for MCM. This is however done without upsetting traditional NN architectures, but rather trying to provide clear reasons for the setting of network parameters. The analytical work will be verified with numerical tests, which will also enable practical considerations, and by application of the suggested guidelines to the popular Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) experimental dataset.},

  abstract = {Diagnostics of rotating machinery has developed significantly in the last decades, and industrial applications are spreading in different sectors. Most applications are characterized by varying velocities of the shaft and in many cases transients are the most critical to monitor. In these variable speed conditions, fault symptoms are clearer in the angular/ order domains than in the common time/frequency ones. In the past, this issue was often solved by synchronously sampling data by means of phase locked circuits governing the acquisition; however, thanks to the spread of cheap and powerful microprocessors, this procedure is nowadays rarer; sampling is usually performed at constant time intervals, and the conversion to the order domain is made by means of digital signal processing techniques. In the last decades different algorithms have been proposed for the extraction of an order spectrum from a signal sampled asynchronously with respect to the shaft rotational velocity; many of them (the so called computed order tracking family) use interpolation techniques to resample the signal at constant angular increments, followed by a common discrete Fourier transform to shift from the angular domain to the order domain. A less exploited family of techniques shifts directly from the time domain to the order spectrum, by means of modified Fourier transforms. This paper proposes a new transform, named velocity synchronous discrete Fourier transform, which takes advantage of the instantaneous velocity to improve the quality of its result, reaching performances that can challenge the computed order tracking.},

  abstract = {The cost of large scale data collection and annotation often makes the application of machine learning algorithms to new tasks or datasets prohibitively expensive. One approach circumventing this cost is training models on synthetic data where annotations are provided automatically. Despite their appeal, such models often fail to generalize from synthetic to real images, necessitating domain adaptation algorithms to manipulate these models before they can be successfully applied. Existing approaches focus either on mapping representations from one domain to the other, or on learning to extract features that are invariant to the domain from which they were extracted. However, by focusing only on creating a mapping or shared representation between the two domains, they ignore the individual characteristics of each domain. We hypothesize that explicitly modeling what is unique to each domain can improve a model's ability to extract domain-invariant features. Inspired by work on private-shared component analysis, we explicitly learn to extract image representations that are partitioned into two subspaces: one component which is private to each domain and one which is shared across domains. Our model is trained to not only perform the task we care about in the source domain, but also to use the partitioned representation to reconstruct the images from both domains. Our novel architecture results in a model that outperforms the state-of-the-art on a range of unsupervised domain adaptation scenarios and additionally produces visualizations of the private and shared representations enabling interpretation of the domain adaptation process.},

Methods that can analyze system behavior, fault conditions, and degradation are crucial for PHM applications, as they create the basis for determining, predicting, and monitoring the health of engineering systems. Data-driven methods have been proven to be suitable for automated diagnosis or prognosis due to their pattern recognition and anomaly detection abilities. Moreover, they do not require knowledge of the underlying degradation process. However, training data-driven methods usually requires a large amount of data, whose collection, cleansing, organization, and preparation are generally very time-consuming and costly. There are usually little or no run-to-failure data available at market launch, especially for new systems such as new machine generations. Nevertheless, related systems, hereinafter referred to as similar systems, often already exist, differing only in some technical characteristics. In this paper, the similar system problem is defined, and explanations of the difficulties that arise when using data from similar systems are presented. Furthermore, it is discussed why the usage of these data offers great potential for condition diagnosis and prognosis of engineering systems. An overview of data-driven methods that can be used to utilize data from similar systems is provided, and the methods that such systems already consider are highlighted. Two related research areas are identified, namely, fleet learning and transfer learning. In the paper, it is shown that similar system approaches will become an important branch of research in PHM.

Existing work in outlier detection regards being an outlier as a binary property. In this paper, we contend that for many scenarios, it is more meaningful to assign to each object a degree of being an outlier. This degree is called the local outlier factor (LOF) of an object. It is local in that the degree depends on how isolated the object is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood. We give a detailed formal analysis showing that LOF enjoys many desirable properties. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that LOF can be used to find outliers which appear to be meaningful, but can otherwise not be identified with existing approaches. Finally, a careful performance evaluation of our algorithm confirms we show that our approach of finding local outliers can be practical.},

  abstract = {The monitoring of rotating machinery is an essential task in today's production processes. Currently, several machine learning and deep learning-based modules have achieved excellent results in fault detection and diagnosis. Nevertheless, to further increase user adoption and diffusion of such technologies, users and human experts must be provided with explanations and insights by the modules. Another issue is related, in most cases, with the unavailability of labeled historical data that makes the use of supervised models unfeasible. Therefore, a new approach for fault detection and diagnosis in rotating machinery is here proposed. The methodology consists of three parts: feature extraction, fault detection and fault diagnosis. In the first part, the vibration features in the time and frequency domains are extracted. Secondly, in the fault detection, the presence of fault is verified in an unsupervised manner based on anomaly detection algorithms. The modularity of the methodology allows different algorithms to be implemented. Finally, in fault diagnosis, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), a technique to interpret black-box models, is used. Through the feature importance ranking obtained by the model explainability, the fault diagnosis is performed. Two tools for diagnosis are proposed, namely: unsupervised classification and root cause analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown on three datasets containing different mechanical faults in rotating machinery. The study also presents a com\- parison between models used in machine learning explainability: SHAP and Local Depth-based Feature Importance for the Isolation Forest (Local-DIFFI).

  abstract = {The monitoring of rotating machinery is an essential task in today's production processes. Currently, several machine learning and deep learning-based modules have achieved excellent results in fault detection and diagnosis. Nevertheless, to further increase user adoption and diffusion of such technologies, users and human experts must be provided with explanations and insights by the modules. Another issue is related, in most cases, with the unavailability of labeled historical data that makes the use of supervised models unfeasible. Therefore, a new approach for fault detection and diagnosis in rotating machinery is here proposed. The methodology consists of three parts: feature extraction, fault detection and fault diagnosis. In the first part, the vibration features in the time and frequency domains are extracted. Secondly, in the fault detection, the presence of fault is verified in an unsupervised manner based on anomaly detection algorithms. The modularity of the methodology allows different algorithms to be implemented. Finally, in fault diagnosis, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), a technique to interpret black-box models, is used. Through the feature importance ranking obtained by the model explainability, the fault diagnosis is performed. Two tools for diagnosis are proposed, namely: unsupervised classification and root cause analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown on three datasets containing different mechanical faults in rotating machinery. The study also presents a com\- parison between models used in machine learning explainability: SHAP and Local Depth-based Feature Importance for the Isolation Forest (Local-DIFFI). Lastly, an analysis of several state-ofart anomaly detection algorithms in rotating machinery is included.},

In this scenario, the present paper introduces a novel blind deconvolution method based on the generalized Rayleigh quotient and solved by means of an iterative eigenvalue decomposition algorithm. This approach not only is characterized by a weighting matrix that drives the deconvolution process, but can also be easily adapted to arbitrary criteria. Based on this framework, a novel criterion rooted on the maximization of the cyclostationarity of the excitation -- as typically encountered with machine faults -- is proposed and compared with other blind deconvolution methods existing in the literature. The comparisons involve both synthesized and real vibration signals, taking into account a gear tooth spall and an outer race bearing fault. The results reveal superior capability to recover impulsive cyclostationary sources with respect to other blind deconvolution methods, even in the presence of impulsive noise or under non-constant speed.},

Synthetic signals are commonly used to provide early validation of vibration-based diagnostics techniques. In the absence of a standard tool, each researcher builds his/her own model keeping into account the characteristic features expected in a faulted condition. This approach implies two main consequences. The first one is that the complexity of simulated signals strictly depends on the researcher skills that could lead to excessively simple models that compromises the validation process. The second one is that there is not a widely accepted algorithm, or tool, for the generation of synthetic signals. This lack hinders simpler and consistent comparisons among signal processing techniques. Hence, the main goal of this paper is to supply to the scientific community a standard tool for the generation of synthetic mechanical signatures. The tool is provided under Creative Commons license and it allows to simulate different possible situations: from the basic case of a single bearing fault to the case of a multi-stage gearbox having either a localized fault and a distributed bearing fault. Among several features, the proposed tool could take also into account variable speed profiles of the input shaft, cyclostationary contributions and effects of linear time-invariant systems.},

  abstract = {In recent years, there have been studies focusing on the use of different types of autoencoders (AEs) for monitoring complex nonlinear data coming from industrial and chemical processes. However, in many cases the focus was placed on detection. As a result, practitioners are encountering problems in trying to interpret such complex models and obtaining candidate variables for root cause analysis once an alarm is raised. This paper proposes a novel statistical process control (SPC) framework based on orthogonal autoencoders (OAEs). OAEs regularize the loss function to ensure no correlation among the features of the latent variables. This is extremely beneficial in SPC tasks, as it allows for the invertibility of the covariance matrix when computing the Hotelling T 2 statistic, significantly improving detection and diagnosis performance when the process variables are highly correlated. To support the fault diagnosis and identification analysis, we propose an adaptation of the integrated gradients (IG) method. Numerical simulations and the benchmark Tennessee Eastman Process are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach by comparing it to traditional approaches as principal component analysis (PCA) and kernel PCA (KPCA). In the analysis, we explore how the information useful for fault detection and diagnosis is stored in the intermediate layers of the encoder network. We also investigate how the correlation structure of the data affects the detection and diagnosis of faulty variables. The results show how the combination of OAEs and IG represents a compelling and ready-to-use solution, offering improved detection and diagnosis performances over the traditional methods.},

Instantaneous spectrum estimation is an important method to analyze nonstationary signals. Through it, the transient characteristics of these signals can be obtained in both time and frequency domain. A new fault diagnosis method for rolling bearing is proposed by combining instantaneous spectrum estimation with FRFT. Firstly, the optimal order of fractional Fourier transform is determined using the principle of maximum kurtosis coefficient. Then the 2-D fractional domain power spectrum under the selected fractional order is obtained using the rotation property of fractional Fourier transform. Furthermore, the energy intensity of each frequency component in the fractional domain is achieved by integrating the time-frequency spectrum along the time axis, and is applied to the fault diagnosis. The simulated signal and some actual bearing fault data are processed to verify the effectiveness with Renyi entropy introduced as an evaluation parameter. Experimental results show that the new algorithm has higher time-frequency resolution. Especially, there is a good aggregation for weak fault signals. The proposed method can obtain more accurate characteristic frequency identification and provide a new alternative for fault diagnosis of rolling bearing.},

  abstract = {The Mahalanobis distances have been introduced in habitat selection studies for the estimation of environmental suitability maps (ESMs). The pixels of raster maps of a given area correspond to points in the multidimensional space defined by the mapped environmental variables (ecological space). The Mahalanobis distances measure the distances in this space between these points and the mean of the ecological niche (i.e., the hypothesized optimum for the species) regarding the structure of the niche. The map of these distances over the area of interest is an estimated ESM. Several authors recently noted that the use of a single optimum for the niche of a species may lead to biased predictions of animal occurrence. They proposed to use instead a minimum set of basic habitat requirements, found by partitioning the Mahalanobis distances into a restricted set of biologically meaningful axes. However, the statistical approach they proposed does not take into account the environmental conditions on the area where the niche was sampled (i.e., the environmental availability), and we show that including this availability is necessary. We used their approach as a basis to develop a new exploratory tool, the Mahalanobis distance factor analysis (MADIFA), which performs an additive partitioning of the Mahalanobis distances taking into account this availability. The basic habitat requirements of a species can be derived from the axes of the MADIFA. This method can also be used to compute ESMs using only this small number of basic requirements, therefore including only the biologically relevant information. We also prove that the MADIFA is complementary to the commonly used ecological-niche factor analysis (ENFA). We used the MADIFA method to analyze the niche of the chamois Rupicapra rupicapra in a mountainous area. This method adds to the existing set of tools for the description of the niche.

Well-known anomaly detection algorithms often suffer from challenges posed by network data, such as high dimension and sparsity, and a lack of anomaly data for training, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. Our approach is to introduce new regularizers to a classical autoencoder (AE) and a variational AE, which force normal data into a very tight area centered at the origin in the nonsaturating area of the bottleneck unit activations. These trained AEs on normal data will push normal points toward the origin, whereas anomalies, which differ from normal data, will be put far away from the normal region. The models are very different from common regularized AEs, sparse AE, and contractive AE, in which the regularized AEs tend to make their latent representation less sensitive to changes of the input data. The bottleneck feature space is now used as a new data representation. A number of one-class learning algorithms are used for evaluating the proposed models. The experiments testify that our models help these classifiers to perform efficiently and consistently on highdimensional and sparse network datasets, even with relatively few training points. More importantly, the models can minimize the effect of model selection on these classifiers since their performance is insensitive to a wide range of hyperparameter settings.},

  abstract = {Early diagnosis of gear transmission has been a significant challenge, because gear faults occur primarily at microstructure or even material level but their effects can only be observed indirectly at a system level. The performance of a gear fault diagnosis system depends significantly on the features extracted and the classifier subsequently applied. Traditionally, fault-related features are extracted and identified based on domain expertise through data preprocessing which are system-specific and may not be easily generalized. On the other hand, although recently the deep neural networks based approaches featuring adaptive feature extractions and inherent classifications have attracted attention, they usually require a substantial set of training data. Aiming at tackling these issues, this paper presents a deep convolutional neural network-based transfer learning approach. The proposed transfer learning architecture consists of two parts; the first part is constructed with a pre-trained deep neural network that serves to extract the features automatically from the input, and the second part is a fully connected stage to classify the features that needs to be trained using gear fault experimental data. Case analyses using experimental data from a benchmark gear system indicate that the proposed approach not only entertains preprocessing free adaptive feature extractions, but also requires only a small set of training data.},

  abstract = {Health condition monitoring of rotating machinery is a crucial task to guarantee reliability in industrial processes. In particular, bearings are mechanical components used in most rotating devices and they represent the main source of faults in such equipments; reason for which research activities on detecting and diagnosing their faults have increased. Fault detection aims at identifying whether the device is or not in a fault condition, and diagnosis is commonly oriented towards identifying the fault mode of the device, after detection. An important step after fault detection and diagnosis is the analysis of the magnitude or the degradation level of the fault, because this represents a support to the decision-making process in condition based-maintenance. However, no extensive works are devoted to analyse this problem, or some works tackle it from the fault diagnosis point of view. In a rough manner, fault severity is associated with the magnitude of the fault. In bearings, fault severity can be related to the physical size of fault or a general degradation of the component. Due to literature regarding the severity assessment of bearing damages is limited, this paper aims at discussing the recent methods and techniques used to achieve the fault severity evaluation in the main components of the rolling bearings, such as inner race, outer race, and ball. The review is mainly focused on data-driven approaches such as signal processing for extracting the proper fault signatures associated with the damage degradation, and learning approaches that are used to identify degradation patterns with regards to health conditions. Finally, new challenges are highlighted in order to develop new contributions in this field.},

Therefore, in this paper, the goal is to provide the explainability for machine fault detection for social IoTs and realize the health monitoring and prognosis of the bearings simultaneously. Specifically, vibration signals from multiple sensors are transformed into spectrograms by short-time Fourier transform. Afterward, the features of frequency-domain data are extracted by the Squeeze-and-Excitation block and self-attention mechanism to assess the degradation of whole system. As such, when the process enters the early degradation, the source of components that causes the abnormality can be identified through the attention weight distribution. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves high accuracy in run-to-failure tests. Moreover, the proposed approach shows a better ability to explain the predicted results than the state-of-the-art bearing detection methods.},

Data-driven fault diagnosis techniques based on Deep Learning (DL) have recently gained increasing attention due to theirs powerful feature learning capacity. However, one of the critical challenges lies in how to embed domain diagnosis knowledge into DL to obtain suitable features that correlate well with the health conditions and to generate better predictors. In this paper, a novel DL-based fault diagnosis method, based on 2D map representations of Cyclic Spectral Coherence (CSCoh) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), is proposed to improve the recognition performance of rolling element bearing faults. Firstly, the 2D CSCoh maps of vibration signals are estimated by cyclic spectral analysis to provide bearing discriminative patterns for specific type of faults. The motivation for using CSCoh-based preprocessing scheme is that the valuable health condition information can be revealed by exploiting the second-order cyclostationary behavior of bearing vibration signals. Thus, the difficulty of feature learning in deep diagnosis model is reduced by leveraging domain-related diagnosis knowledge. Secondly, a CNN model is constructed to learn high-level feature representations and conduct fault classification. More specifically, Group Normalization (GN) is employed in CNN to normalize the feature maps of network, which can reduce the internal covariant shift induced by data distribution discrepancy. The proposed method is tested and evaluated on two experimental datasets, including data category imbalances and data collected under different operating conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve high diagnosis accuracy under different datasets and present better generalization ability, compared to state-of-the-art fault diagnosis techniques.},

  abstract = {Recently, deep learning-based intelligent fault diagnosis techniques have obtained good classification performance with amount of supervised training data. However, domain shift problem between the training and testing data usually occurs due to variation in operating conditions and interferences of environment noise. Transfer learning provides a promising tool for handling the cross-domain diagnosis problems by leveraging knowledge from the source domain to help learning in the target domain. Most existing studies attempt to learn both domain features in a common feature space to reduce the domain shift, which are not optimal on specific discriminative tasks and can be limited to small shifts. This article proposes a novel domain adversarial transfer network (DATN), exploiting task-specific feature learning networks and domain adversarial training techniques for handling large distribution discrepancy across domains. First, two asymmetric encoder networks integrating deep convolutional neural networks are designed for learning hierarchical representations from the source domain and target domain. Then, the network weights learned in source tasks are transferred to improve training on target tasks. Finally, domain adversarial training with inverted label loss is introduced to minimize the difference between source and target distributions. To validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in the presence of large domain shifts, two fault data sets from different test rigs are investigated, and different fault severities, compound faults, and data contaminated by noise are considered. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the average accuracy of 96.45\% on the bearing data set and 98.92\% on the gearbox data set, which outperforms other algorithms.},

  abstract = {Chest X-ray (CXR) is the most typical radiological exam for diagnosis of various diseases. Due to the expensive and time-consuming annotations, detecting anomalies in CXRs in an unsupervised fashion is very promising. However, almost all of the existing methods consider anomaly detection as a one-class classification (OCC) problem. They model the distribution of only known normal images during training and identify the samples not conforming to normal profile as anomalies in the testing phase. A large number of unlabeled images containing anomalies are thus ignored in the training phase, although they are easy to obtain in clinical practice. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy, Dual-distribution Discrepancy for Anomaly Detection (DDAD), utilizing both known normal images and unlabeled images. The proposed method consists of two modules. During training, one module takes both known normal and unlabeled images as inputs, capturing anomalous features from unlabeled images in some way, while the other one models the distribution of only known normal images. Subsequently, inter-discrepancy between the two modules, and intra-discrepancy inside the module that is trained on only normal images are designed as anomaly scores to indicate anomalies. Experiments on three CXR datasets demonstrate that the proposed DDAD achieves consistent, significant gains and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract = {The governing equation of mass--spring--damper dynamics usually consists of a known structure and undetermined nonlinear components. This work proposes a physics-informed method to learn the unknown component by modeling its evolution with an auto-encoder Koopman operator. The Koopman operator is well known for its global linearization of dynamics and sensitivity to spectral modes. The undetermined component in an oscillatory equation of motion (EOM) is first reconstructed by a time-delay neural network whose inputs stack past sequences of observables and the control. Then, the evolution of the undetermined component is globally linearized and propagated by the Koopman operator in a latent space created by an auto-encoder neural network. Ultimately, observables at the future timestep are forecasted by timestepping the original EOM. Uniting an incomplete EOM and the Koopman operator, the proposed physics-informed Koopman neural ordinary differential equation (PiKNODE) method shows competitive edges compared with several black- and grey-box benchmarks in four synthetic and experimental case studies. Additionally, an anomaly-detection technique based on the Jensen--Shannon distance is proposed to boost the practicality of the PiKNODE for structural health monitoring.},

Based on vibration signals, this paper presents an implementation of deep learning algorithm convolutional neural network (CNN) used for fault identification and classification in gearboxes. Different combinations of condition patterns based on some basic fault conditions are considered. 20 test cases with different combinations of condition patterns are used, where each test case includes 12 combinations of different basic condition patterns. Vibration signals are preprocessed using statistical measures from the time domain signal such as standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. In the frequency domain, the spectrum obtained with FFT is divided into multiple bands, and the root mean square (RMS) value is calculated for each one so the energy maintains its shape at the spectrum peaks. The achieved accuracy indicates that the proposed approach is highly reliable and applicable in fault diagnosis of industrial reciprocating machinery.

  abstract = {Early fault identification of the rolling element bearings remains difficult because the repetitive transient signature generated via localized incipient damage is easily submerged by various interference components and strong noise. Spectral coherence (SCoh) is a breakthrough approach for revealing the second-order cyclostationary of bearing faults by displaying the energy flow of vibration signal jointly in a two-dimensional plane comprising the resonance frequency and bearing fault frequency. Considering the non-uniformity of fault information distribution in the whole spectral frequency band, the enhanced envelope spectrum (EES) obtained by integrating over the full spectral frequency band is vulnerable to strong background noise. Thus, how to identify an informative spectral frequency band for constructing a diagnostic improved envelope spectrum (IES) is crucial to accurately identify bearing faults. To address this issue, a featureadaptive method called IES via Candidate Fault Frequency Optimization-gram (IESCFFOgram) is proposed to determine the informative spectral frequency band from SCoh for bearing fault diagnosis. The innovation of this method is to fully excavate the fault information hidden in the SCoh and adaptively determine the informative spectral frequency band according to the iden\- tified candidate fault frequencies. The proposed method is tested and validated on simulated signals, vibration datasets obtained from artificial fault bearing experiments, and accelerated bearing degradation tests. In addition, comparisons with state-of-the-art methods have been conducted to highlight the superiority of the proposed methodology.},

However, most previous assessment methods need the rich domain knowledge or labeled historical data and are not adaptive to time-varying working conditions. To address these challenges, a novel two-stage online unsupervised optimization framework for machine performance assessment is proposed without relying on any historical abnormal and faulty data. In the first stage, high-dimensional features are extracted from the raw monitoring signals and then projected into the low-dimensional space for feature selection. A distance metric learning-based clustering model considering separability is proposed to simultaneously detect the incipient fault initial time and search the most effective features, which can separate the normal and degradation stages more distinctly. In the second stage, once the incipient fault is identified, a composite HI is generated based on Mahalanobis distance between the normal features and current degradation features. An adaptive information-theoretic metric learning algorithm is developed to iteratively optimize and update the HI for online degradation assessment, whose objective function is formulated based on LogDet divergence, and the monotonicity and robust\- ness properties. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated through applica\- tions to two bearing datasets.},

  abstract = {The vibration signal of a faulty rolling bearing exhibits typical non-stationarity -- often in the form of cyclostationarity. The spectrum tools often used to characterize cyclostationarity mainly include envelope spectrum, squared envelope spectrum and log-envelope spectrum. In this paper, new detection methods of cyclostationarity are developed for obtaining a larger family of enve\- lope analysis and their effectiveness in rolling bearing fault diagnosis is evaluated rigorously. Firstly, based on the simplified Box-Cox transformation, the generalized envelope signals are constructed from the analytic signal for demodulation purposes, and then a spectrum family named generalized envelope spectra (GESs) is proposed to reveal cyclostationarity. Especially, GESs with different transformation parameters exhibit different performance advantages against the random impulse noise and Gaussian background noise which are commonly present in rolling bearing vibration signals. Subsequently, a novel spectrum tool that combines the performance advantages of different GESs, called product envelope spectrum (PES), is developed to strengthen the capability to detect cyclostationarity. Finally, an enhanced envelope analysis named Product Envelope Spectral Optimization-gram (PESOgram) is proposed to improve the accuracy and robustness of PES for rolling bearing fault diagnosis in the presence of different fault-unrelated interference noises. The performance of the PESOgram method is validated on numerically generated signal and experimental signals collected from two railway axle bearing test rigs and compared with several state-of-the-art envelope analysis methods. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for fault diagnosis of rolling bearings and its advantages over other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {Learning to rank has become an important research topic in machine learning. While most learning-to-rank methods learn the ranking functions by minimizing loss functions, it is the ranking measures (such as NDCG and MAP) that are used to evaluate the performance of the learned ranking functions. In this work, we reveal the relationship between ranking measures and loss functions in learningto-rank methods, such as Ranking SVM, RankBoost, RankNet, and ListMLE. We show that the loss functions of these methods are upper bounds of the measurebased ranking errors. As a result, the minimization of these loss functions will lead to the maximization of the ranking measures. The key to obtaining this result is to model ranking as a sequence of classification tasks, and define a so-called essential loss for ranking as the weighted sum of the classification errors of individual tasks in the sequence. We have proved that the essential loss is both an upper bound of the measure-based ranking errors, and a lower bound of the loss functions in the aforementioned methods. Our proof technique also suggests a way to modify existing loss functions to make them tighter bounds of the measure-based ranking errors. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the modifications can lead to better ranking performances, demonstrating the correctness of our theoretical analysis.},

  abstract = {In industry (e.g., wind power), gearboxes often operate under random speed variations. A condition monitoring system is expected to detect faults and assess their severity using vibration signals collected under different speed profiles. A few studies have been reported for condition monitoring of gearboxes under random speed variations, including a novelty diagnostic method and a support vector machine (SVM) based method. However, these methods either are based on the strict assumption that the rotating speed does not vary significantly within a rotating cycle or have the drawback of low classification accuracy. This paper presents a time series model-based method for gear tooth crack detection and severity assessment under random speed variation. Specifically, the rotating speed and phase are considered as covariates in a linear parameter varying autoregression (AR) model for representing impulsive vibration signals. We propose refined B-splines for mapping the dependency between AR coefficients and the rotating phase. The performance of the presented time series model-based method has been validated using laboratory signals. The presented method can assess 93.8\% of the tooth crack severity state correctly, which is better than the novelty diagnostic method (74.4\%) and SVM-based method (87.7\%).},

  abstract = {In the realm of industrial maintenance, early fault detection (EFD) in bearing components is pivotal for the seamless operation and longevity of machinery. The complexity of accurately identifying early faults lies in the dynamic, heterogeneous nature of sensor data and the scarcity of high-quality labeled datasets. This scarcity poses a significant challenge, as it hampers the ability to implement effective online fault detection mechanisms, leading to potential downtimes and costly maintenance. To address these challenges, this article introduces an unsupervised framework grounded in dual-domain contrastive learning (DDCL) and tri-indicator joint alarm strategy (TJAS) for the EFD of bearings. First, building upon momentum contrastive learning, we propose a DDCL approach that effectively harnesses both time-domain information and frequency-domain information from a vast amount of unlabeled bearing data to train a feature extractor. Subsequently, a tri-indicator alarm strategy, which jointly utilizes anomaly scores (ASs), permutation entropy (PE), and root mean square values, is designed to process the features outputted by the extractor and identify anomalous time steps. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) Challenge 2012 bearing dataset and the XJTU-SY dataset using the proposed framework. Ablation studies indicate that the DDCL effectively captures the differences between normal and anomalous data points, and the TJAS significantly reduces false alarms. Comparative experiments further demonstrate that our method detected early stage faults on average 425 samples ahead of existing approaches and reduced false alarms by an average of 30.},

Specifically, many systems lack the ability to identify when outliers (e.g., samples that are distinct from and not represented in the training data distribution) are being presented to the system. The ability to detect outliers is of practical significance since it can help the system behave in an reasonable way when encountering unexpected data. In prior work, outlier detection is commonly carried out in a processing pipeline that is distinct from the classification model. Thus, for a complete system that incorporates outlier detection and classification, two models must be trained, increasing the overall complexity of the approach. In this paper we use the concept of the null space to integrate an outlier detection method directly into a neural network used for classification. Our method, called Null Space Analysis (NuSA) of neural networks, works by computing and controlling the magnitude of the null space projection as data is passed through a network. Using these projections, we can then calculate a score that can differentiate between normal and abnormal data. Results are shown that indicate networks trained with NuSA retain their classification performance while also being able to detect outliers at rates similar to commonly used outlier detection algorithms.},

This article explores an unsupervised feature learning method for machinery health monitoring by proposing a generative adversarial networks (GAN) model that exploits the merits of the autoencoder and the traditional GAN. The major contribution is that the data distribution of the normal samples is accurately learned by the GAN model within both the signal spectrum and latent representation spaces. Specifically, the discriminative feature for machinery health monitoring is learned in an unsupervised manner by the proposed method in three steps. First, the proposed GAN model is trained by the normal samples of the inspected machine with the aim to correctly reconstruct the signal spectrum and its latent representation. Then, the trained model is applied to test the online samples of the same machine with unknown health conditions. Finally, the dissimilarity between the tested samples and their reconstructed ones in the latent representation space is taken as the discriminative feature. The feature value will increase significantly if a fault occurs in the inspected machine because the abnormal samples are never trained in the proposed GAN model. Experimental studies on three different machines are conducted to validate the proposed method and its superiority over the traditional methods in detecting abnormal points and characterizing fault propagation.},

In the presented signal model, we analyze the complicated modulation sidebands in terms of frequency and reveal the amplitude modulation effect of the carrier. Results show that amplitudes of modulation sidebands are slightly asymmetric for a single planet system, while the amplitudes of modulation sidebands are asymmetric for the multiple planets system. Furthermore, methods for suppressing the vibration are proposed by designing the appropriate planet position angles, meshing phasing, and load sharing performance. Finally, simulation and experimental signals are compared to verify the proposed model. The result shows that experimental signals keep good consistency with the simulated signals.},

This question is motivated by empirical work that suggests that single channel ICA can sometimes be used to separate out important components from a time series. Here we show that as long as the sources are reasonably spectrally disjoint then we can identify and approximately separate out individual sources. However, the linear nature of the separation equations means that when the sources have substantially overlapping spectra both identification using standard ICA and linear separation are no longer possible.},

A corollary is the notion of an achievable PR curve, which has properties much like the convex hull in ROC space; we show an efficient algorithm for computing this curve. Finally, we also note differences in the two types of curves are significant for algorithm design. For example, in PR space it is incorrect to linearly interpolate between points. Furthermore, algorithms that optimize the area under the ROC curve are not guaranteed to optimize the area under the PR curve.},

This framework, termed physics-guided neural networks (PGNN), leverages the output of physics-based model simulations along with observational features in a hybrid modeling setup to generate predictions using a neural network architecture. Further, this framework uses physics-based loss functions in the learning objective of neural networks to ensure that the model predictions not only show lower errors on the training set but are also scientifically consistent with the known physics on the unlabeled set. We illustrate the effectiveness of PGNN for the problem of lake temperature modeling, where physical relationships between the temperature, density, and depth of water are used to design a physics-based loss function. By using scientific knowledge to guide the construction and learning of neural networks, we are able to show that the proposed framework ensures better generalizability as well as scientific consistency of results.

  abstract = {There is an increasingly apparent need for validating the classifications made by deep learning systems in safety-critical applications like autonomous vehicle systems. A number of recent papers have proposed methods for detecting anomalous image data that appear different from known inlier data samples, including reconstruction-based autoencoders. Autoencoders optimize the compression of input data to a latent space of a dimensionality smaller than the original input and attempt to accurately reconstruct the input using that compressed representation. Since the latent vector is optimized to capture the salient features from the inlier class only, it is commonly assumed that images of objects from outside of the training class cannot effectively be compressed and reconstructed. Some thus consider reconstruction error as a kind of novelty measure. Here we suggest that reconstruction-based approaches fail to capture particular anomalies that lie far from known inlier samples in latent space but near the latent dimension manifold defined by the parameters of the model. We propose incorporating the Mahalanobis distance in latent space to better capture these out-of-distribution samples and our results show that this method often improves performance over the baseline approach.},

  abstract = {Intelligent fault diagnosis of train bogie bearings based on edge computing is a promising technology to ensure the safety and reliability of train operation, which can give fault diagnosis systems better real-time performance and lower communication costs. Lightweight diagnosis networks are the core of this technology. However, existing lightweight diagnosis networks have the following limitations: 1) they lack a lightweight learning mechanism for edge computing scenarios to deal with time-scale changes of bearing fault features when trains operate under variational conditions and 2) an adaptive neural network pruning technique synchronized with training is expected to avoid the repetitive and cumbersome processes of traditional pruning techniques. To overcome the above limitations, this article proposes a new multiscale lightweight network with adaptive pruning for the intelligent diagnosis fault of train bogie bearings in edge computing scenarios. First, weight-sharing multiscale convolutions (WSMSCs) are developed to capture multi-time scale features from vibration signals with extremely low computing costs. Then, inverse separable convolution (ISC) blocks are built to further capture high-level features, and an adaptive pruning technique that does not require artificial jobs is proposed to eliminate useless network structures concurrently with training. Finally, diagnostic results are obtained through a dense layer activated by Softmax. Experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy and complexity of the proposed network are superior to other state-of-the-art lightweight bearing fault diagnosis networks under varying operating conditions. Furthermore, the proposed networks can be deployed on more general edge devices.},

Furthermore, the explainable prognostics model is developed to solve a supervised multicriteria decision-making problem leading to symbolic life expressions, which are accurate and interpretable. Finally, MEeCHMP is applied to bearing life testes involving three-axis acceleration signals to demonstrate its performance in a real case.},

More precisely, we develop a one-class Fischer's criterion in which the maximization provides both the regression parameters and the separation of the data in two classes: typical data and atypical data or outliers. This new criterion is built on the statistical properties of the subspace decomposition of the hat matrix. From this angle, we improve the discriminative properties of the hat matrix which is traditionally used as outlier diagnostic measure in linear regression. Naturally, we call this new approach discriminative hat matrix. The proposed algorithm is fully nonsupervised and needs only the initialization of one parameter. Synthetic and real datasets are used to study the performance both in terms of regression and classification of the proposed approach.

Although mathematically sound, this work presents some further shortcomings. First, the performance of the method relies on the assumption that the density between the target data and outliers is different. However, this consideration can easily prove to be over-optimistic for real world data sets making the method unreliable, at least directly. Secondly, this contrast measure is similar to a Generalized Rayleigh Quotient which is renowned for being sensitive to the small sample size problem. In this paper, we propose a null-space based version of their algorithm in order to unlock all these shortcomings and fully benefit from the interest of the approach. By this way, we show that the method can be used in a semi-supervised mode by considering that target objects can be beforehand collected and will serve as referentials to classify unseen objects. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data sets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

In this paper, a kernelized version of their criterion is presented. Originally on the basis of an iterative optimization process, alternating between subspace selection and clustering, I show here that their criterion has an upper bound making these two problems independent. In particular, the estimation of the label vector is formulated as an unconstrained binary linear problem (UBLP) which can be solved using an iterative perturbation method. Once the label vector is estimated, an optimal projection subspace is obtained by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem. Like many other kernel methods, the performance of the proposed approach depends on the choice of the kernel. Constructed with a Gaussian kernel, I show that the proposed contrast measure is an efficient indicator for selecting an optimal kernel width. This property simplifies the model selection problem which is typically solved by costly (generalized) cross-validation procedures. Initialization, convergence analysis, and computational complexity are also discussed. Lastly, the proposed algorithm is compared with recent novelty detectors on synthetic and real data sets.},

Rather than a single single-phase spectral analysis or a space vector component spectral analysis using the classic Fourier Transform, The Quaternion Fourier Transform was used to do a full spectral analysis of the three-phase currents scheme. Spectral indicators are given from the Quaternion Power Spectral Density and their use suggested for accurate detection and diagnosis of bearing faults via the quaternion's formalism. To validate this approach, the proposed indicators were compared to fault indicators derived from a singlephase or inferred from the real and imaginary parts of the currents space vector. The results reveal that two of the new metrics outperform the classic ones derived from either single-phase spectral analysis or the three-phase space vector components spectral analysis (classification rates of 94.2 percent and 93.8 percent, respectively). These findings support the preference for three-phase approaches over single-phase approaches, as well as the ability to extend classical research methods developed for single-phase systems to three-phase systems using the Quaternion Fourier transform.},

The appearance of stator current components or increase of magnitude of some components at characteristic frequencies indicates a motor fault condition. In this paper, we propose a new MCSA fault detector based on a matched subspace technique. The proposed detector consists of three steps. First, the influence of the fundamental supply frequency is removed from the current signal using an interference cancellation technique based on oblique projection. Then, the fault-related frequency is estimated from the interference-free signal using the maximum likelihood (ML) principle. Finally, the fault detection is performed using a generalized likelihood ratio test. Simulation and experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for eccentricity fault, bearing faults and broken rotor bars detection.},

  abstract = {Structural damage detection using unsupervised learning methods has been a trending topic in the structural health monitoring (SHM) research community during the past decades. In the context of SHM, unsupervised learning methods rely only on data acquired from intact structures for training the statistical models. Consequently, they are often seen as more practical than their supervised counterpart in implementing an early-warning damage detection system in civil structures. In this article, we review publications on data-driven structural health monitoring from the last decade that relies on unsupervised learning methods with a focus on real-world application and practicality. Novelty detection using vibration data is by far the most common approach for unsupervised learning SHM and is, therefore, given more attention in this article. Following a brief introduction, we present the state-of-the-art studies in unsupervised-learning SHM, categorized by the types of used machine-learning methods. We then examine the benchmarks that are commonly used to validate unsupervised-learning SHM methods. We also discuss the main challenges and limitations in the existing literature that make it difficult to translate SHM methods from research to practical applications. Accordingly, we outline the current knowledge gaps and provide recommendations for future directions to assist researchers in developing more reliable SHM methods.},

The AR filter technique has been proven superior for detecting localised gear tooth faults than the traditionally used residual analysis technique. The AR filter technique is based on subtracting a regular gearmesh signal, as represented by the toothmesh harmonics and immediately adjacent sidebands, from the spectrum of a signal from one gear obtained by the synchronous signal averaging technique (SSAT). The existing AR filter technique performs well but is based on autocorrelation measurements and is thus insensitive to phase relationships which can be used to differentiate noise from impulses. The MED technique can make a use of the phase information by means of the higher-order statistical (HOS) characteristics of the signal, in particular the kurtosis, to enhance the ability to detect emerging gear tooth faults. The experimental results presented in this paper validate the superior performance of the combined AR and MED filtering techniques in detecting spalls and tooth fillet cracks in gears.},

  abstract = {Most generative models of audio directly generate samples in one of two domains: time or frequency. While sufficient to express any signal, these representations are inefficient, as they do not utilize existing knowledge of how sound is generated and perceived. A third approach (vocoders/synthesizers) successfully incorporates strong domain knowledge of signal processing and perception, but has been less actively researched due to limited expressivity and difficulty integrating with modern auto-differentiation-based machine learning methods. In this paper, we introduce the Differentiable Digital Signal Processing (DDSP) library, which enables direct integration of classic signal processing elements with deep learning methods. Focusing on audio synthesis, we achieve high-fidelity generation without the need for large autoregressive models or adversarial losses, demonstrating that DDSP enables utilizing strong inductive biases without losing the expressive power of neural networks. Further, we show that combining interpretable modules permits manipulation of each separate model component, with applications such as independent control of pitch and loudness, realistic extrapolation to pitches not seen during training, blind dereverberation of room acoustics, transfer of extracted room acoustics to new environments, and transformation of timbre between disparate sources. In short, DDSP enables an interpretable and modular approach to generative modeling, without sacrificing the benefits of deep learning. The library is publicly available1 and we welcome further contributions from the community and domain experts.},

As a convex optimization problem, the existing BDs have poor optimization performance and cannot effectively enhance the impulsive signature excited by weak faults. Moreover, the existing BDs require manual derivation of the calculation process, which brings great inconvenience to the researcher's personalized design of the maximization criterion. A new BD algorithm based on backward automatic differentiation is proposed, which is named backward automatic differentiation blind deconvolution (BADBD). The calculation process does not require manual derivation so a general solution of BDs based on different maximization criteria is realized. BADBD constructs multiple cascaded filters to filter the raw vibration signal, which makes up for the deficiency of single filter performance. The filter coefficients are determined by Adam algorithm, which improves the optimization performance of the proposed BADBD. BADBD is compared with classic BDs by synthesized and real vibration signals. The results reveal superior capability of BADBD to enhance the impulsive signature and the fault diagnosis performance is significantly better than the classic BDs.},

This data structure naturally motivates the simultaneous exploration of the joint and individual variation within each data block resulting in new insights. For instance, there is a strong desire to integrate the multiple genomic data sets in The Cancer Genome Atlas to characterize the common and also the unique aspects of cancer genetics and cell biology for each source. In this paper we introduce Angle-Based Joint and Individual Variation Explained capturing both joint and individual variation within each data block. This is a major improvement over earlier approaches to this challenge in terms of a new conceptual understanding, much better adaption to data heterogeneity and a fast linear algebra computation. Important mathematical contributions are the use of score subspaces as the principal descriptors of variation structure and the use of perturbation theory as the guide for variation segmentation. This leads to an exploratory data analysis method which is insensitive to the heterogeneity among data blocks and does not require separate normalization. An application to cancer data reveals different behaviors of each type of signal in characterizing tumor subtypes. An application to a mortality data set reveals interesting historical lessons.

Vibration analysis is a widely used condition monitoring technique for high-speed rotating machinery. Using the information contained in the vibration signals, an automatic method for bearing fault detection and diagnosis is presented in this work. Initially, a one-class m-SVM is used to discriminate between normal and faulty conditions. In order to build a model of normal operation regime, only data extracted under normal conditions is used. Band-pass filters and Hilbert Transform are then used sequentially to obtain the envelope spectrum of the original raw signal that will finally be used to identify the location of the problem. In order to check the performance of the method, two different data sets are used: (a) real data from a laboratory test-to-failure experiment and (b) data obtained from a fault-seeded bearing test. The results showed that the method was able not only to detect the failure in an incipient stage but also to identify the location of the defect and qualitatively assess its evolution over time.},

It describes the basic principles of qualitative modeling, and a variety of qualitative representations that have been developed for quantities and for relationships between them, providing a kind of qualitative mathematics. Three ontological frameworks for organizing modeling knowledge (processes, components, and field) are summarized, along with research on automatically assembling models for particular tasks from such knowledge. Qualitative simulation and how it carves up time into meaningful units is discussed. We discuss several accounts of causal reasoning about dynamical systems, based on different choices of qualitative mathematics and ontology. Qualitative spatial reasoning is explored, both in terms of relational systems and visual reasoning. Applications of qualitative models of particular interest to cognitive scientists are described, including how they have been used to capture the expertise of scientists and engineers and how they have been used in education.

One way to define a score is to use autoencoders, which rely on the ability to reconstruct certain types of data (background) but not others (signals). In this paper, we study some challenges associated with variational autoencoders, such as the dependence on hyperparameters and the metric used, in the context of anomalous signal (top and W ) jets in a QCD background. We find that the hyperparameter choices strongly affect the network performance and that the optimal parameters for one signal are non-optimal for another. In exploring the networks, we uncover a connection between the latent space of a variational autoencoder trained using mean-squared-error and the optimal transport distances within the dataset. We then show that optimal transport distances to representative events in the background dataset can be used directly for anomaly detection, with performance comparable to the autoencoders. Whether using autoencoders or optimal transport distances for anomaly detection, we find that the choices that best represent the background are not necessarily best for signal identification. These challenges with unsupervised anomaly detection bolster the case for additional exploration of semi-supervised or alternative approaches.},

Processing such signals requires careful feature engineering, particularly the extraction of meaningful time-frequency features. This can be time-consuming and the performance is often dependent on the choice of parameters. To address these limitations, we propose a deep learning framework for learnable wavelet packet transforms, enabling to learn features automatically from data and optimise them with respect to the defined objective function. The learned features can be represented as a spectrogram, containing the important time-frequency information of the dataset. We evaluate the properties and performance of the proposed approach by evaluating its improved spectral leakage and by applying it to an anomaly detection task for acoustic monitoring.},

We present a tutorial on nonparametric inference and its relation to neural networks, and we use the statistical viewpoint to highlight strengths and weaknesses of neural models. We illustrate the main points with some recognition experiments involving artificial data as well as handwritten numerals. In way of conclusion, we suggest that current-generation feedforward neural networks are largely inadequate for difficult problems in machine perception and machine learning, regardless of parallel-versus-serial hardware or other implementation issues. Furthermore, we suggest that the fundamental challenges in neural modeling are about representation rather than learning per se. This last point is supported by additional experiments with handwritten numerals.},

Specifically, we design a new model called Deep ReconstructionClassification Network (DRCN), which jointly learns a shared encoding representation for two tasks: (i) supervised classification of labeled source data, and (ii) unsupervised reconstruction of unlabeled target data. In this way, the learnt representation not only preserves discriminability, but also encodes useful information from the target domain. Our new DRCN model can be optimized by using backpropagation similarly as the standard neural networks.},

We give recommendations about the choice of parameters used to calculate the distances, including the size of the sub-sample of simplices used to improve computation time, if needed. We introduce a new family of distances which we call k-minimal-variance distances. Each of these distances is constructed using polynomials in the sample covariance matrix, with the aim of providing an alternative to the inverse covariance matrix, that is applicable when data is degenerate. We explore some applications of the considered distances, including outlier detection and clustering, and compare how the behaviour of the distances is affected for different parameter choices.},

However, the dominant paradigm for training Preference Models (PMs) for that purpose suffers from fundamental limitations, such as lack of transparency and scalability, along with susceptibility to overfitting the preference dataset. We propose Compositional Preference Models (CPMs), a novel PM framework that decomposes one global preference assessment into several interpretable features, obtains scalar scores for these features from a prompted LM, and aggregates these scores using a logistic regression classifier. Through these simple steps, CPMs allow to control which properties of the preference data are used to train the preference model and to build it based on features that are believed to underlie the human preference judgment. Our experiments show that CPMs not only improve generalization and are more robust to overoptimization than standard PMs, but also that best-of-n samples obtained using CPMs tend to be preferred over samples obtained using conventional PMs. Overall, our approach demonstrates the benefits of endowing PMs with priors about which features determine human preferences while relying on LM capabilities to extract those features in a scalable and robust way.},

However, the predictive performance of purely unsupervised anomaly detection often fails to match the required detection rates in many tasks and there exists a need for labeled data to guide the model generation. Our first contribution shows that classical semi-supervised approaches, originating from a supervised classifier, are inappropriate and hardly detect new and unknown anomalies. We argue that semi-supervised anomaly detection needs to ground on the unsupervised learning paradigm and devise a novel algorithm that meets this requirement. Although being intrinsically non-convex, we further show that the optimization problem has a convex equivalent under relatively mild assumptions. Additionally, we propose an active learning strategy to automatically filter candidates for labeling. In an empirical study on network intrusion detection data, we observe that the proposed learning methodology requires much less labeled data than the state-of-the-art, while achieving higher detection accuracies.},

The reconstruction error of deep autoencoders has been widely used in the literature for this purpose, but this approach does not fully exploit the hierarchical nature of deep models. Instead, we propose to take advantage of the disentangled representations of data that are available in the latent space of autoencoders, by using the latent reconstruction error as machine health indicator. We have tested our proposal on three different datasets, considering two types of autoencoders (deep autoencoder and variational autoencoder), and comparing its performance with that of state-of-the-art approaches in terms of well-known quality metrics. The results of the research demonstrate the capability of our health indicator to outperform conventional approaches, in the three datasets, and regardless of the type of autoencoder used to generate the residuals. In addition, we provide some intuition on the suitability of latent spaces for the monitoring of machinery condition.},

Early attempts at explaining this phenomenon focused on nonlinearity and overfitting. We argue instead that the primary cause of neural networks' vulnerability to adversarial perturbation is their linear nature. This explanation is supported by new quantitative results while giving the first explanation of the most intriguing fact about them: their generalization across architectures and training sets. Moreover, this view yields a simple and fast method of generating adversarial examples.

This task applies to various problems, such as audio cod-ing or audio restoration. In this article, we focus on efficient bandwidth extension of monophonic and polyphonic musical signals using a differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP) model. Such a model is composed of a neural network part with relatively few parameters trained to infer the parameters of a differentiable digital signal processing model, which efficiently generates the output full-band audio signal. We first address bandwidth extension of monophonic signals, and then propose two methods to explicitly handle polyphonic signals. The benefits of the proposed models are first demonstrated on monophonic and polyphonic syn-thetic data against a baseline and a deep-learning-based ResNet model. The models are next evaluated on recorded monophonic and polyphonic data, for a wide variety of instruments and musical genres. We show that all proposed models surpass a higher complexity deep learning model for an objective metric computed in the frequency domain. A MUSHRA listening test confirms the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of perceptual quality.},

The basic concept and major advantage of the method, is that its training can be performed using simulation data, which result from a well established model, describing the dynamic response of defective rolling element bearings. Then, vibration measurements, resulting from the machine under condition monitoring, can be imported and processed directly by the already trained SVM, eliminating thus the need of training the SVM with experimental data of the specific defective bearing. A key aspect of the method is the data preprocessing approach, which among others, includes order analysis, in order to overcome problems related to sudden changes of the shaft rotating speed. Moreover, frequency domain features both from the raw signal as well as from the demodulated signal are used as inputs to the SVM classifiers for a two-stage recognition and classification procedure. At the first stage, a SVM classifier separates the normal condition signals from the faulty signals. At the second stage, a SVM classifier recognizes and categorizes the type of the fault. The effectiveness of the method tested in one literature established experimental test case and in three different industrial test cases, including a total number of 34 measurements. Each test case includes successive measurements from bearings under different types of defects, different loads and different rotation speeds. In all cases, the method presents 100\% classification success.},

  abstract = {We present a new estimation principle for parameterized statistical models. The idea is to perform nonlinear logistic regression to discriminate between the observed data and some artificially generated noise, using the model log-density function in the regression nonlinearity. We show that this leads to a consistent (convergent) estimator of the parameters, and analyze the asymptotic variance. In particular, the method is shown to directly work for unnormalized models, i.e. models where the density function does not integrate to one. The normalization constant can be estimated just like any other parameter. For a tractable ICA model, we compare the method with other estimation methods that can be used to learn unnormalized models, including score matching, contrastive divergence, and maximum-likelihood where the normalization constant is estimated with importance sampling. Simulations show that noise-contrastive estimation offers the best trade-off between computational and statistical efficiency. The method is then applied to the modeling of natural images: We show that the method can successfully estimate a large-scale two-layer model and a Markov random field.},

In such a scenario physics-based modeling requires great effort or is not possible at all.

The proposed approach is applied to bearing damage detection in technological processes of ore defragmentation. From the signal processing perspective, this corresponds to the identification of cyclic and non-cyclic impulses in the vibrations. A new informative frequency band selector based on the conditional variance statistic is proposed and studied in details. In particular, it is shown that the proposed method is superior to many common alternatives based e.g. on Kurtosis or Alpha selectors, especially when non-cyclic impulses dominate over the cyclic ones. Moreover, it is shown that the approach based on conditional variance is simple to implement and much more robust concerning various problem specifications like cyclic to non-cyclic impulse number ratio or amplitude ratio. The Monte Carlo method is used to validate the robustness of the method in the statistical sense.},

  abstract = {Wheelset bearing is a critical and easily damaged component of a high-speed train. Wheelset bearing fault diagnosis is of great significance to ensure safe operation of high-speed trains and realize intelligent operation and maintenance. The convolutional sparse coding technique based on the dictionary learning algorithm (CSCT-DLA) provides an effective algorithm framework for extracting the impulses caused by bearing defect. However, dictionary learning is easily affected by foundation vibration and harmonic interference and cannot learn the key structure related to fault impulses. At the same time, the detection performance of fault impulse heavily depends on the selection of parameters in this approach. Union of convolutional dictionary learning algorithm (UC-DLA) is an efficient algorithm in CSCT-DLA. In this paper, UC-DLA is introduced and improved for wheelset bearing fault detection. Finally, a novel bearing fault detection method, adaptive UC-DLA combined with bandwidth optimization (AUC-DLA-BO), is proposed. The mathematical formulation of AUC-DLA-BO is a sort of constrained optimization problem, which can overcome foundation vibration and harmonic interference and adaptively determine parameters related to UC-DLA. The proposed method can detect the fault resonance band adaptively, eliminate the noise with the same frequency band as the fault resonance band, and highlight the bearing fault impulses. Simulated signals and bench tests are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that AUC-DLA-BO can effectively detect bearing faults and realize the refined analysis of fault behavior.},

However, existing efforts highly depend on the availability of fault data in source domain, which is rare in practice due to the regular maintenance. Fortunately, self-customized testbeds provide an opportunity to easily obtain fault data, assuming that the simulated data can be utilized to monitor the real-world traction motor systems via the crossmachine diagnosis method. Besides, current deep learning-based cross-machine fault diagnosis methods suffer from the poor physical interpretability and the troublesome hype-parameter selection. To tackle aforementioned issues, a one-stage Interpretable and Differentiable STFT cross-machine dual-driven adaptation Network (IDSN) is proposed. In IDSN, a new paradigm termed interpretable differentiable STFT layer is devised, where a derivable coefficient is introduced to adjust pivotal parameters of STFT such as window length by the gradient descent. Prominently, it is a plug-and-play module, which can be embedded into the arbitrary typical network without conflict. Besides, a novel adaptive trade-off coefficient is developed to tackle the weight matching of the domain discrepancy metric. Finally, to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of cross-machine diagnosis, a concise yet valid smoothed joint maximum mean discrepancy is proposed, which simultaneously promotes intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. The results of experiments confirm that the proposed IDSN outperforms the state of the art.},

We study the effect of various generative parameter settings on the relative risks between the optimal hypothesis, hypothesis i), and hypothesis ii). Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimal classifier in several EEG- and ECG-based classification problems and argue that the optimal classifier can be computed without access to direct information from any of the individual source tasks, leading to the preservation of privacy.

The common method for using the CWRU dataset for demonstrating domain shift is described and a potential flaw is identified. It is argued that the accepted procedure of con\- structing training and testing datasets with different operating conditions does not constitute a useful domain shift problem since the same physical bearings exist in both training and testing sets. To remedy this while using the CWRU dataset, an alternative benchmarking framework is proposed that constructs training and testing datasets with independent sets of bearings. The original and the proposed benchmarking frameworks are compared by training a set of commonly cited diagnosis CNNs within each framework. The results indicate that the original framework allows CNNs to learn features related to specific bearings and may not be able to generalize for different bearings. It is also found that using existing state-of-the-art deep CNNs from other fields in machine learning research may currently present a more efficient option than developing custom CNN architectures for diagnosis when large machine fault datasets are unavailable.},

In this paper we present new findings and connections between ROC space and cost space. In particular, we show that ROC curves can be transferred to cost space by means of a very natural threshold choice method, which sets the decision threshold such that the proportion of positive predictions equals the operating condition. We call these new curves rate-driven curves, and we demonstrate that the expected loss as measured by the area under these curves is linearly related to AUC. We show that the rate-driven curves are the genuine equivalent of ROC curves in cost space, establishing a point-point rather than a point-line correspondence. Furthermore, a decomposition of the rate-driven curves is introduced which separates the loss due to the threshold choice method from the ranking loss (Kendall {$\tau$} distance). We also derive the corresponding curve to the ROC convex hull in cost space; this curve is different from the lower envelope of the cost lines, as the latter assumes only optimal thresholds are chosen.},

  year = {2024},
  abstract = {In many fields, as exemplified by machine condition monitoring, the use of neural networks (NN) for the processing of signals is attracting more attention than the use of established knowledge-based approaches. While for decades researchers have focussed on designing and refining signal processing techniques based on their a priori understanding of the properties of signals, in the last few years this approach has been challenged by a posteriori justified artificial-intelligence (AI) techniques. The inability to provide reasons for the choice of NN structures has been accompanied by a lack of understanding of what the NN does to reach a certain output, which significantly compromises the trust in this approach. The importance of the NN input domain of representations (e.g., signal representation in time and/or frequency domains) is well understood. However, the effects of the choice of input domain on the network architecture and its overall effectiveness remain unexplored for the case of periodic signals. Therefore, the approach of interpretable NN will need to be further examined in terms of the role of the input to the NN. In this paper, the authors aim at applying a signal-processing-guided analysis to neural networks operating on both time and frequency domain representations of periodic signals. The scope of this work will include NN based on convolutional and fully connected layers. The paper will analyse how the role of these layers will change depending on the domain of the input signal and propose an effective solution to frequency-domain analysis consisting of a CNN with stride equal to kernel size.},

With recent advancements in deep learning, researchers have designed efficient one-class anomaly detection methods. Existing works commonly use neural networks to map the data into a more informative representation and then apply an anomaly detection algorithm. In this paper, we propose a method, DASVDD, that jointly learns the parameters of an autoencoder while minimizing the volume of an enclosing hypersphere on its latent representation. We propose a novel anomaly score that combines the autoencoder's reconstruction error and the distance from the center of the enclosing hypersphere in the latent representation. Minimizing this anomaly score aids us in learning the underlying distribution of the normal class during training. Including the reconstruction error in the anomaly score ensures that DASVDD does not suffer from the hypersphere collapse issue since the DASVDD model does not converge to the trivial solution of mapping all inputs to a constant point in the latent representation. Experimental evaluations on several benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the commonly used state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms while maintaining robust performance across different anomaly classes.},

  abstract = {Adaptive extraction of concerned components (CC) from mixed frequency components remains to be a challenging topic in various research domains. Most existing adaptive mode decomposition algorithms for extracting CC, such as wavelet transform, wavelet packet transform, singular value decomposition, empirical mode decomposition, empirical wavelet transform, and variational mode decomposition, are intrinsically adaptive band-pass filter banks and they face the following two tough problems. The first problem is that they cannot separate CC from interferential com\- ponents in same frequency bands. The second problem is that it is not fully effective in auto\- matically selecting CC distributed in different frequency bands by using some designed criteria. In this paper, a new decomposition approach called difference mode decomposition (DMD) is pro\- posed to adaptively decompose a mixed signal into CC, reference components, and noise, and enrich the domain of adaptive mode decomposition. The proposed DMD relies on convex opti\- mization and Fourier transform, and its decomposition is mathematically justified and composes physical interpretations. Analyses of simulated and real-world bearing and gear vibration signals are used to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed DMD over existing adaptive mode decomposition algorithms. It is demonstrated that the proposed DMD can effectively extract CC such as repetitive transients caused by bearing and gear faults. Moreover, since the proposed DMD is based on Fourier transform expanded by trigonometric basis functions, the proposed DMD can be easily extended to other domains by expanding basis functions besides the frequency domain.},

  abstract = {Since bearings are key components of rotatory machines and they are prone to have faults, bearing fault diagnosis has received much attention. Because vibration signals collected from the casing of a machine contain sufficient fault information, bandpass filtering-based envelope demodulation on vibration signals has been a standard approach for bearing fault diagnosis. Before envelope demodulation, selection of informative frequency bands (IFBs) for bandpass filtering to enhance fault signatures is of vital importance to achieve a good bearing fault diagnosis performance. Even though a fast kurtogram as a classic approach for IFB selection has been widely studied and many variants were proposed, they are still affected by interference caused by impulsive noise in the time domain and discrete frequencies in the frequency domain. To solve this tough problem, this article proposes an OSESgram for IFB selection. The core of the proposed OSESgram is that healthy and faulty vibration signals are formulated as a convex optimization problem to aid IFB selection, i.e., a data-driven optimized square envelope spectrum (OSES) rather than a square envelope or a square envelope spectrum is quantified to select an IFB. Since the OSES is obtained in a data-driven way, the proposed OSESgram is promising to be more robust to interferential noise in vibration signals, especially under the existence of random impulsive noise. Benchmark and industrial bearing vibration datasets are used to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed OSESgram. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed OSESgram is more effective and robust in indicating an IFB than the fast kurtogram and an improved kurtogram.},

Attempts to apply Shannon's information theory to problems beyond communications have, in the large, come to grief. The failure of these attempts could have been predicted because no theory that involves just the probabilities of outcomes without considering their consequences could possibly be adequate in describing the importance of uncertainty to a decision maker.

  abstract = {Deriving health indicators of rotating machines is crucial for their maintenance. However, this process is challenging for the prevalent adopted intelligent methods since they may take the whole data distributions, not only introducing noise interference but also lacking the explainability. To address these issues, we propose a diffusion-based weakly-supervised approach for deriving health indicators of rotating machines, enabling early fault detection and continuous monitoring of condition evolution. This approach relies on a classifier-free diffusion model trained using healthy samples and a few anomalies. This model generates healthy samples. and by comparing the differences between the original samples and the generated ones in the envelope spectrum, we construct an anomaly map that clearly identifies faults. Health indicators are then derived, which can explain the fault types and mitigate noise interference. Comparative studies on two cases demonstrate that the proposed method offers superior health monitoring effectiveness and robustness compared to baseline models.},

  abstract = {A fundamental problem in neural network research, as well as in many other disciplines, is finding a suitable representation of multivariate data, i.e. random vectors. For reasons of computational and conceptual simplicity, the representation is often sought as a linear transformation of the original data. In other words, each component of the representation is a linear combination of the original variables. Well-known linear transformation methods include principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection pursuit. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a recently developed method in which the goal is to find a linear representation of non-Gaussian data so that the components are statistically independent, or as independent as possible. Such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications, including feature extraction and signal separation. In this paper, we present the basic theory and applications of ICA, and our recent work on the subject. ·≠ß 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Study Design and Setting: Correct inferences [true positives (TPs) and true negatives (TNs)] increase and wrong inferences (false positives and false negatives) decrease the value of a study. We model the composite value of a study based on these four inferences, their relative importance, and relative frequency using multiplicative and additive models. Numerical examples are presented for randomized trials, epidemiologic studies, and agnostic omics investigations with massive testing and variable sample size constraints. Results: The optimal choice of type I and type II errors varies a lot according to the available sample size and the plausible effect sizes in each field. We show how equations can be streamlined for special applications: when the value of all four inferences is considered equal, when the identification of TNs carries no value, and when a study carries no value unless at least one TP is discovered. Conclusion: The proposed optimization equations can be used to guide the selection of the optimal type I and type II errors of future studies in which sample size is constrained. {\'O} 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Floods and droughts are driven, in part, by spatial patterns of extreme rainfall. Heat waves are driven by spatial patterns of extreme temperature. It is therefore of interest to design statistical methodologies that allow the rapid identification of likely patterns of extreme rain or temperature from observed historical data. The standard work-horse for the rapid identification of patterns of climate variability in historical data is Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and its variants. But PCA optimizes for variance not spatial extremes, and so there is no particular reason why the first PCA spatial pattern should identify, or even approximate, the types of patterns that may drive floods, droughts or heatwaves, even if the linear assumptions underlying PCA are correct. We present an alternative pattern identification algorithm that makes the same linear assumptions as PCA, but which can be used to explicitly optimize for spatial extremes. We call the method Directional Component Analysis (DCA), since it involves introducing a preferred direction, or metric, such as ``sum of all points in the spatial field''. We compare the first PCA and DCA spatial patterns for U.S. and China winter and summer rainfall anomalies, using the sum metric for the definition of DCA in order to focus on total rainfall anomaly over the domain. In three out of four of the examples the first DCA spatial pattern is more uniform over a wide area than the first PCA spatial pattern and as a result is more obviously relevant to large-scale flooding or drought. Also, in all cases the definitions of PCA and DCA result in the first PCA spatial pattern having the larger explained variance of the two patterns, while the first DCA spatial pattern, when scaled appropriately, has a higher likelihood and greater total rainfall anomaly, and indeed is the pattern with the highest total rainfall anomaly for a given likelihood. The first DCA spatial pattern is arguably the best answer to the question: what single spatial pattern is most likely to drive large total rainfall anomalies in the future? It is also simpler to calculate than PCA. In combination PCA and DCA patterns yield more insight into rainfall variability and extremes than either pattern on its own.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of manufacturing industry, machine fault diagnosis has become increasingly significant to ensure safe equipment operation and production. Consequently, multifarious approaches have been explored and developed in the past years, of which intelligent algorithms develop particularly rapidly. Convolutional neural network (CNN), as a typical representative of intelligent diagnostic models, has been extensively studied and applied in recent five years, and a large amount of literature has been published in academic journals and conference proceedings. However, there has not been a systematic review to cover these studies and make a prospect for the further research. To fill in this gap, this work attempts to review and summarize the development of the Convolutional Network based Fault Diagnosis (CNFD) approaches comprehensively. Generally, a typical CNFD framework is composed of the following steps, namely, data collection, model construction, and feature learning and decision making, thus this paper is organized by following this stream. Firstly, data collection process is described, in which several popular datasets are introduced. Then, the fundamental theory from the basic CNN to its variants is elaborated. After that, the applications of CNFD are reviewed in terms of three mainstream directions, i.e. classification, prediction and transfer diagnosis. Finally, conclusions and prospects are presented to point out the characteristics of current development, facing challenges and future trends. Last but not least, it is expected that this work would provide convenience and inspire further exploration for researchers in this field.},

This can be seen as a non-stationary signal whose statistical properties switch intermittently between two states. Based on this observation, the paper introduces an automated diagnosis framework that integrates the successive steps of fault detection, fault identification and fault characterization. The advantage is that the complete diagnosis process is completed at once, while involving a limited number of hyperparameters. The approach relies on modeling the raw vibration signal with an explicit-duration hidden Markov model (EDHMM) and then uses the estimated model parameters for diagnosis. The detection of a fault is first achieved by means of a likelihood ratio test built on the EDHMM parameters. Posterior probabilities are then used for identifying the fault type automatically. Finally, the fault size is estimated from the duration times returned by the EDHMM. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated on independent experimental datasets.},

We analyze two prominent classes of methods; the first class uses regularization based on the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) of parameters, whereas the other uses a student-teacher paradigm, referred to as Knowledge Distillation (KD). The Fisher criterion can be interpreted as regularizing the network by penalizing the approximate KL-divergence (KLD) between the output of the original model and that of the quantized model. The KD approach bypasses the need to estimate the FIM and directly minimizes the KLD between the two models. We place these two approaches in a unified setting, and study their generalization characteristics using their loss landscapes. Using CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, we show that for higher temperatures, distillation produces wider minima in loss landscapes and yields higher accuracy than the Fisher criterion.},

  abstract = {Early detection of breast cancer is a powerful tool towards decreasing its socioeconomic burden. Although, artificial intelligence (AI) methods have shown remarkable results towards this goal, their ``black box'' nature hinders their wide adoption in clinical practice. To address the need for AI guided breast cancer diagnosis, interpretability methods can be utilized. In this study, we used AI methods, i.e., Random Forests (RF), Neural Networks (NN) and Ensembles of Neural Networks (ENN), towards this goal and explained and optimized their performance through interpretability techniques, such as the Global Surrogate (GS) method, the Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots and the Shapley values (SV). The Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset of the open UCI repository was used for the training and evaluation of the AI algorithms. The best performance for breast cancer diagnosis was achieved by the proposed ENN (96.6\% accuracy and 0.96 area under the ROC curve), and its predictions were explained by ICE plots, proving that its decisions were compliant with current medical knowledge and can be further utilized to gain new insights in the pathophysiological mechanisms of breast cancer. Feature selection based on features' importance according to the GS model improved the performance of the RF (leading the accuracy from 96.49\% to 97.18\% and the area under the ROC curve from 0.96 to 0.97) and feature selection based on features' importance according to SV improved the performance of the NN (leading the accuracy from 94.6\% to 95.53\% and the area under the ROC curve from 0.94 to 0.95). Compared to other approaches on the same dataset, our proposed models demonstrated state of the art performance while being interpretable.},

Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-t ime domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-b ased regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-d imensional problems.},

The domain knowledge is assumed to be described as a conjunction of hard inequality constraints which appears to be a natural choice for several applications. Compared to other neuro-symbolic approaches, the proposed method converges to a model that satisfies any inequality constraint on the training data and does not require to first transform the constraints into some ad-hoc term that is added to the learning (optimisation) objective. Under certain conditions, it is shown that CGGD can converges to a model that satisfies the constraints on the training set, while prior work does not necessarily converge to such a model. It is empirically shown on two independent and small data sets that CGGD makes training less dependent on the initialisation of the network and improves the constraint satisfiability on all data.},

  abstract = {We consider prediction and uncertainty analysis for systems which are approximated using complex mathematical models. Such models, implemented as computer codes, are often generic in the sense that by a suitable choice of some of the model's input parameters the code can be used to predict the behaviour of the system in a variety of specific applications. However, in any specific application the values of necessary parameters may be unknown. In this case, physical observations of the system in the specific context are used to learn about the unknown parameters. The process of fitting the model to the observed data by adjusting the parameters is known as calibration. Calibration is typically effected by ad hoc fitting, and after calibration the model is used, with the fitted input values, to predict the future behaviour of the system. We present a Bayesian calibration technique which improves on this traditional approach in two respects. First, the predictions allow for all sources of uncertainty, including the remaining uncertainty over the fitted parameters. Second, they attempt to correct for any inadequacy of the model which is revealed by a discrepancy between the observed data and the model predictions from even the best-fitting parameter values. The method is illustrated by using data from a nuclear radiation release at Tomsk, and from a more complex simulated nuclear accident exercise.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the potential to improve the fault detection capability of sparsitybased blind filtering. It optimizes a finite impulse response filter to maximize the sparsity of the squared envelope spectrum (SES) of vibration signals. However, the method is to be highly prone to fail optimization due to the immense number of non-fault-related second-order cyclostationary interferences. These interferences can skew the sparsity estimation of the SES and thus impair the sparsity-based blind filtering method. Even whitening or signal separation methods can fail to remove such cyclostationary components adequately. Hence, the technique is unlikely to function particularly on the signals measured on complex industrial machines. This paper extends the initial study introducing sparsity-based blind filtering in the literature. It proposes refining the filter optimization's objective function by targeting narrow frequency bandwidths on the SES to avoid non-fault-related peaks. The narrow bandwidths are selected by exploiting the available engineering knowledge, such as an average shaft speed. The proof of concept is shown on simulated signals, and the performance tests are made on signals measured on an industrial rotating machine and a wind turbine gearbox. The study's outcome demonstrates that targeting automatically selected narrow bandwidths bounded by shaft speed harmonics can significantly improve the detection capability of sparsity-based blind filtering.},

Often, we're interested in going a step further, and want to approximate the true joint distribution over observed and latent variables, including the true prior and posterior distributions over latent variables. This is known to be generally impossible due to unidentifiability of the model. We address this issue by showing that for a broad family of deep latentvariable models, identification of the true joint distribution over observed and latent variables is actually possible up to very simple transformations, thus achieving a principled and powerful form of disentanglement. Our result requires a factorized prior distribution over the latent variables that is conditioned on an additionally observed variable, such as a class label or almost any other observation. We build on recent developments in nonlinear ICA, which we extend to the case with noisy or undercomplete observations, integrated in a maximum likelihood framework. The result also trivially contains identifiable flow-based generative models as a special case.},

  abstract = {Unsupervised anomaly detection is a daunting task, as it relies solely on normality patterns from the training data to identify unseen anomalies during testing. Recent approaches have focused on leveraging domain-specific transformations or perturbations to generate synthetic anomalies from normal samples. The objective here is to acquire insights into normality patterns by learning to differentiate between normal samples and these crafted anomalies. However, these approaches often encounter limitations when domain-specific transformations are not well-specified such as in tabular data, or when it becomes trivial to distinguish between them. To address these issues, we introduce a novel domain-agnostic method that employs a set of conditional perturbators and a discriminator. The perturbators are trained to generate input-dependent perturbations, which are subsequently utilized to construct synthetic anomalies, and the discriminator is trained to distinguish normal samples from them. We ensure that the generated anomalies are both diverse and hard to distinguish through two key strategies: i) directing perturbations to be orthogonal to each other and ii) constraining perturbations to remain in proximity to normal samples. Throughout experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art benchmarks, which is evident not only in image data but also in tabular data, where domain-specific transformation is not readily accessible. Additionally, we empirically confirm the adaptability of our method to semi-supervised settings, demonstrating its capacity to incorporate supervised signals to enhance anomaly detection performance even further.},

Several methods have been proposed to regularize the FIM for increased generalization of DNNs. However, they cannot be used directly for Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) because the variable parameters of BNNs make it difficult to calculate the FIM. To address this problem, we achieve regularization of the FIM of BNNs by specifying a new suitable prior distribution called the inverse-reference (IR) prior. To regularize the FIM, the IR prior is derived as the inverse of the reference prior that imposes minimal prior knowledge on the parameters and maximizes the trace of the FIM. We demonstrate that the IR prior can enhance the generalization ability of BNNs for large-scale data over previously used priors while providing adequate uncertainty quantifications using various benchmark image datasets and BNN structures.},

In this paper, we theoretically and experimentally reveal that the PA protocol has a great possibility of overestimating the detection performance; that is, even a random anomaly score can easily turn into a state-of-the-art TAD method. Therefore, the comparison of TAD methods after applying the PA protocol can lead to misguided rankings. Furthermore, we question the potential of existing TAD methods by showing that an untrained model obtains comparable detection performance to the existing methods even when PA is forbidden. Based on our findings, we propose a new baseline and an evaluation protocol. We expect that our study will help a rigorous evaluation of TAD and lead to further improvement in future researches.},

The goal of unsupervised-ADS is to detect unknown anomalous sound without training data of anomalous sound. Use of an AE as a normal model is a state-of-the-art technique for unsupervisedADS. To decrease the false positive rate (FPR), the AE is trained to minimize the reconstruction error of normal sounds and the anomaly score is calculated as the reconstruction error of the observed sound. Unfortunately, since this training procedure does not take into account the anomaly score for anomalous sounds, the true positive rate (TPR) does not necessarily increase. In this study, we define an objective function based on the NeymanPearson lemma by considering ADS as a statistical hypothesis test. The proposed objective function trains the AE to maximize the TPR under an arbitrary low FPR condition. To calculate the TPR in the objective function, we consider that the set of anomalous sounds is the complementary set of normal sounds and simulate anomalous sounds by using a rejection sampling algorithm. Through experiments using synthetic data, we found that the proposed method improved the performance measures of ADS under low FPR conditions. In addition, we confirmed that the proposed method could detect anomalous sounds in real environments.},

A method that also belongs to this class is Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), a spectral decomposition method that extracts spatio-temporal patterns from data. In this paper, we incorporate frequency-based constraints into DMD for an adaptive decomposition that leads to user-controllable visualizations, allowing analysts to include their knowledge into the process. To accomplish this, we derive an equivalent reformulation of DMD that implicitly provides access to the eigenvalues (and therefore to the frequencies) identified by DMD. By utilizing a constrained minimization problem customized to DMD, we can guarantee the existence of desired frequencies by minimal changes to DMD. We complement this core approach by additional techniques for constrained DMD to facilitate explorative visualization and investigation of time series data. With several examples, we demonstrate the usefulness of constrained DMD and compare it to conventional frequency-based decomposition methods.},

In this work, HP is used along with traditional statistical features to improve the polymer gear fault detection accuracy from vibration signals in the early stage. Vibration signals are acquired experimentally at a different class of polymer gear faults, namely healthy, slight, moderate, and severe pitting. The HP and SF vectors are extracted from the optimum intrinsic mode function of empirical mode decomposition and empirical wavelet transform (EWT). After that, faults are classified by three different classification algorithms, namely support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). Evaluating the result of these three classifiers with three sets of feature vectors (SF, HP and a combination of SF and HP) and comparing all the results with raw signal data.

To overcome this issue, a few text generation approaches aim to detoxify toxic texts using additional LMs or perturbations. However, previous methods require excessive memory, computations, and time which are serious bottlenecks in their real-world application. To address such limitations, we propose an effective yet efficient method for language detoxification using an attribute-discriminative latent space. Specifically, we project the latent space of an original Transformer LM onto a discriminative latent space that well-separates texts by their attributes using a projection block and an attribute discriminator. This allows the LM to control the text generation to be nontoxic with minimal memory and computation overhead. We validate our model, AttributeDiscriminative Language Model (ADLM) on detoxified language and dialogue generation tasks, on which our method significantly outperforms baselines both in performance and efficiency.},

Hence, we propose the utilization of backpropagated gradients as representations to characterize model behavior on anomalies and, consequently, detect such anomalies. We show that the proposed method using gradient-based representations achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance in benchmark image recognition datasets.

  abstract = {Reward models (RMs) are at the crux of successfully using RLHF to align pretrained models to human preferences, yet there has been relatively little study that focuses on evaluation of those models. Evaluating reward models presents an opportunity to understand the opaque technologies used for alignment of language models and which values are embedded in them. Resources for reward model training and understanding are sparse in the nascent open-source community around them. To enhance scientific understanding of reward models, we present REWARDBENCH, a benchmark dataset and code-base for evaluation. The REWARDBENCH dataset is a collection of prompt-chosen-rejected trios spanning chat, reasoning, and safety, to benchmark how reward models perform on challenging, structured and out-of-distribution queries. We create specific comparison datasets for RMs that have subtle, but verifiable reasons (e.g. bugs, incorrect facts) why one answer should be preferred to another. On the REWARDBENCH leaderboard, we evaluate reward models trained with a variety of methods, such as the direct MLE training of classifiers and the implicit reward modeling of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We present many findings on propensity for refusals, reasoning limitations, and instruction following shortcomings of various reward models towards a better understanding of the RLHF process.},

For largedimensional covariance matrices, the usual estimator---the sample covariance matrix---is typically not well-conditioned and may not even be invertible. This paper introduces an estimator that is both well-conditioned and more accurate than the sample covariance matrix asymptotically. This estimator is distribution-free and has a simple explicit formula that is easy to compute and interpret. It is the asymptotically optimal convex linear combination of the sample covariance matrix with the identity matrix. Optimality is meant with respect to a quadratic loss function, asymptotically as the number of observations and the number of variables go to infinity together. Extensive Monte Carlo confirm that the asymptotic results tend to hold well in finite sample.},

Most of these efforts have been in the area of machinery PHM, resulting in the development of many algorithms for this particular application. The majority of these algorithms concentrate on applications involving common rotary machinery components, such as bearings and gears. Knowledge of this prior work is a necessity for any future research efforts to be conducted; however, there has not been a comprehensive overview that details previous and on-going efforts in PHM. In addition, a systematic method for developing and deploying a PHM system has yet to be established. Such a method would enable rapid customization and integration of PHM systems for diverse applications. To address these gaps, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the PHM field, followed by an introduction of a systematic PHM design methodology, 5S methodology, for converting data to prognostics information. This methodology includes procedures for identifying critical components, as well as tools for selecting the most appropriate algorithms for specific applications. Visualization tools are presented for displaying prognostics information in an appropriate fashion for quick and accurate decision making. Industrial case studies are included in this paper to show how this methodology can help in the design of an effective PHM system.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a combination of convolutional neural network and auto-encoder (CAE) for unsupervised anomaly detection of industrial gas turbines. Autonomous monitoring systems protect the gas turbines, with the settings unchanged in their lifetime. Those systems can not detect any abnormal operation patterns which potentially risk the equipment after long-term exposure. Recently, machine learning and deep learning models are applied for industries to detect those anomalies under the nominal working range. However, for gas turbine protection, not much deep learning (DL) models are introduced. The proposed CAE detects irregular signals in unsupervised learning by combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) and auto-encoder (AE). CNN exponentially reduces the computational cost and decrease the amount of training data, by its extraction capabilities of essential features in spatial input data. A CAE identifies the anomalies by adapting characteristics of an AE, which identifies any errors larger than usual pre-trained, reconstructed errors. Using the Keras library, we developed an AE structure in one-dimensional convolution layer networks. We used actual plant operation data set for performance evaluation with conventional machine learning (ML) models. Compared to the isolation forest (iforest), k-means clustering (k-means), and one-class support vector machine (OCSVM), our model accurately predicts unusual signal patterns identified in the actual operation than conventional ML models.},

  abstract = {Intelligent fault diagnosis (IFD) refers to applications of machine learning theories to machine fault diagnosis. This is a promising way to release the contribution from human labor and automatically recognize the health states of machines, thus it has attracted much attention in the last two or three decades. Although IFD has achieved a considerable number of successes, a review still leaves a blank space to systematically cover the development of IFD from the cradle to the bloom, and rarely provides potential guidelines for the future development. To bridge the gap, this article presents a review and roadmap to systematically cover the development of IFD following the progress of machine learning theories and offer a future perspective. In the past, traditional machine learning theories began to weak the contribution of human labor and brought the era of artificial intelligence to machine fault diagnosis. Over the recent years, the advent of deep learning theories has reformed IFD in further releasing the artificial assistance since the 2010s, which encourages to construct an end-to-end diagnosis procedure. It means to directly bridge the relationship between the increasingly-grown monitoring data and the health states of machines. In the future, transfer learning theories attempt to use the diagnosis knowledge from one or multiple diagnosis tasks to other related ones, which prospectively overcomes the obstacles in applications of IFD to engineering scenarios. Finally, the roadmap of IFD is pictured to show potential research trends when combined with the challenges in this field.},

  abstract = {Machinery prognostics is one of the major tasks in condition based maintenance (CBM), which aims to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of machinery based on condition information. A machinery prognostic program generally consists of four technical processes, i.e., data acquisition, health indicator (HI) construction, health stage (HS) division, and RUL prediction. Over recent years, a significant amount of research work has been undertaken in each of the four processes. And much literature has made an excellent overview on the last process, i.e., RUL prediction. However, there has not been a systematic review that covers the four technical processes comprehensively. To fill this gap, this paper provides a review on machinery prognostics following its whole program, i.e., from data acquisition to RUL prediction. First, in data acquisition, several prognostic datasets widely used in academic literature are introduced systematically. Then, commonly used HI construction approaches and metrics are discussed. After that, the HS division process is summarized by introducing its major tasks and existing approaches. Afterwards, the advancements of RUL prediction are reviewed including the popular approaches and metrics. Finally, the paper provides discussions on current situation, upcoming challenges as well as possible future trends for researchers in this field.},

The former results in failure detection analysis to avoid upcoming failures whereas the latter leads to both diagnosis and prognosis. The proposed hybrid modelling architecture is validated in the field of rotating machinery using time-domain and frequency-domain analysis. A multi-body model and a semi-supervised learning algorithm are used to perform the hybrid modelling. The state of a rolling element bearing is analysed and accurate results for fault detection, localisation and quantification are obtained. The contextual information increases the accuracy of the results; the results obtained by the model can help improve maintenance decision making and production scheduling.

Condition monitoring of such parts and detecting faults at an early stage are crucial for reducing downtime in the production line and improving plant safety, efficiency and reliability. This paper develops a fault detection and isolation scheme based on an unsupervised machine learning method, sparse autoencoder (SAE), and evaluates the model on industrial multivariate data. The Mahalanobis distance (MD) is employed to calculate the statistical difference of the residual outputs between monitoring and normal states and is used as a system-wide health indicator. Furthermore, fault isolation is achieved by a reconstruction-based two-dimensional contribution map, in which the variables with larger contributions are responsible for the detected fault. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, two case studies are carried out based on a multivariate data set from a pump system in an oil and petrochemical factory. The classical principal component analysis (PCA) method is compared with the proposed method and results show that SAE performs better in terms of fault detection than PCA, and can effectively isolate the abnormal variables, which can hence help effectively trace the root cause of the detected fault.},

As an important aspect of prognostics, remaining useful life (RUL) prediction estimates the remaining usable life of a system, which is essential for maintenance decision making and contingency mitigation. A significant amount of research has been reported in the literature to develop prognostics models that are able to predict a system's RUL. These models can be broadly categorized into experience-based models, date-driven models, and physics-based models. However, due to system complexity, data availability, and application constraints, there is no universally accepted best model to estimate RUL. The review part of this paper specifically focused on the development of hybrid prognostics approaches, attempting to leverage the advantages of combining the prognostics models in the aforementioned different categories for RUL prediction. The hybrid approaches reported in the literature were systematically classified by the combination and interfaces of various types of prognostics models. In the case study part, a hybrid prognostics method was proposed and applied to a battery degradation case to show the potential benefit of the hybrid prognostics approach.},

However, it is usually difficult and expensive to collect sufficient labeled data in real industries, and the difficulty in data preparation significantly hinders the application of the intelligent diagnostic methods. In order to address the data sparsity issue with insufficient labeled data, a deep learning-based fault diagnosis method is proposed in this study, exploring additional unsupervised data which are generally easy for collection. A threestage training scheme is adopted, i.e. pre-training, representation clustering and enhanced supervised learning. The auto-encoder structure is used for feature extraction, and distance metric learning and k-means clustering method are integrated in the neural network architecture for unsupervised learning. Two rotating machinery datasets are used for validations. The proposed method not only achieves promising diagnostic performance on the semi-supervised learning tasks with few labeled data, but also is well suited for pure unsupervised learning problems. The experimental results suggest the proposed method offers a promising approach on exploiting unsupervised data for fault diagnostics.},

The approach elucidates the physical significance and changing patterns of these principal components in the frequency domain. Notably, the second Principal Component-based Fourier Spectrum (PCBFS-2) effectively discriminates between normal and fault frequencies, enabling automated fault feature recognition.

  abstract = {Anomaly detection is a crucial task for monitoring various status (i.e., metrics) of entities (e.g., manufacturing systems and Internet services), which are often characterized by multivariate time series (MTS). In practice, it's important to precisely detect the anomalies, as well as to interpret the detected anomalies through localizing a group of most anomalous metrics, to further assist the failure troubleshooting. In this paper, we propose InterFusion, an unsupervised method that simultaneously models the inter-metric and temporal dependency for MTS. Its core idea is to model the normal patterns inside MTS data through hierarchical Variational AutoEncoder with two stochastic latent variables, each of which learns low-dimensional inter-metric or temporal embeddings. Furthermore, we propose an MCMC-based method to obtain reasonable embeddings and reconstructions at anomalous parts for MTS anomaly interpretation. Our evaluation experiments are conducted on four real-world datasets from different industrial domains (three existing and one newly published dataset collected through our pilot deployment of InterFusion). InterFusion achieves an average anomaly detection F1-Score higher than 0.94 and anomaly interpretation performance of 0.87, significantly outperforming recent state-of-the-art MTS anomaly detection methods.},

Defective machines often generate knocking sounds, e.g., due to loose metal parts, which can be modelled as an approximately periodic sequence of acoustic pulses. Based on a signal model for these sequential pulses, we derive a z-transform-based maximum a posteriori ratio test (MAPRT) detector that reliably detects such knocking noises. The proposed detector is tested with measurement data showing that it is more robust than the commonly used generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) pitch detector. Furthermore, the proposed MAPRT detector can be implemented efficiently using the chirp z-transform.},

  abstract = {Deep Transfer Learning (DTL) is a new paradigm of machine learning, which can not only leverage the advantages of Deep Learning (DL) in feature representation, but also benefit from the superiority of Transfer Learning (TL) in knowledge transfer. As a result, DTL techniques can make DL-based fault diagnosis methods more reliable, robust and applicable, and they have been widely developed and investigated in the field of Intelligent Fault Diagnosis (IFD). Although several systematic and valuable review articles have been published on the topic of IFD, they summarized relevant research only from an algorithm perspective and overlooked practical ap\- plications in industry scenarios. Furthermore, a comprehensive review on DTL-based IFD methods is still lacking. From this insight, it is particularly important and more necessary to compre\- hensively survey the relevant publications of DTL-based IFD, which will help readers to conve\- niently understand the current state-of-the-art techniques and to quickly design an effective solution for solving IFD problems in practice. First, theoretical backgrounds of DTL are briefly introduced to present how the transfer learning techniques can be integrated with deep learning models. Then, major applications of DTL and their recent developments in the field of IFD are detailed and discussed. More importantly, suggestions on how to select DTL algorithms in practical applications, and some future challenges are shared. Finally, conclusions of this survey are given. At last, we have reason to believe that the works done in this article can provide convenience and inspiration for the researchers who want to devote their efforts in the progress and advance of IFD.},

  abstract = {High impedance faults (HIFs) in distribution grids may cause wildfires and threaten human lives. Conventional protection relays at substations fail to detect more than 10\% HIFs since over-currents are low and the signatures of HIFs are local. With more {\textmu}PMU being installed in the distribution system, highresolution {\textmu}PMU datasets provide the opportunity of detecting HIFs from multiple points. Still, the main obstacle in applying the {\textmu}PMU datasets is the lack of labels. To address this issue, we construct a physics-informed convolutional auto-encoder (PICAE) to detect HIFs without labeled HIFs for training. The significance of our PICAE is a physical regularization, derived from the elliptical trajectory of voltages-current characteristics, to distinguish HIFs from other abnormal events even in highly noisy situations. We formulate a system-wide detection framework that merges multiple nodes' local detection results to improve the detection accuracy and reliability. The proposed approaches are validated in the IEEE 34-node test feeder simulated through PSCAD/EMTDC. Our PICAE outperforms the existing works in various scenarios and is robust to different observability and noise.},

Modern helicopter health management system leverages various sensors to collect in-flight signals. In order to trigger an alarm when an anomaly happens, signal processing methods are used to construct health indicators that require expert knowledge. On the other hand, classic features are always case-specific and may fail to discriminate anomalies in practical applications. Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) is a machine learning method used as a one-class classifier to serve anomaly detection tasks. It utilizes healthy samples to construct a hypersphere feature space as a detection threshold. In order to automate the anomaly detection pipeline, a deep SVDD model is proposed in this paper. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used as the feature extractor, which provides smart features to an SVDD model. The SVDD model uses a softboundary hyper-sphere for decision-making. The optimization of the CNN and the SVDD is connected, which makes it an end-to-end process. The methodology is applied, tested and evaluated on a helicopter vibration dataset, which has been provided by Airbus SAS in the frames of an AI Gym challenge. The experimental results reveal that the F1 score of the proposed Deep SVDD can reach 94\%, showing its compelling efficacy for anomaly detection.},

Traditional expert knowledgebased Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) processes can be smartened up with the assistance of various AI techniques, such as deep learning models. On the other hand, current deep learning based prognostics suffers from the data deficit issue, especially considering the varying operating conditions and the degradation modes of the components in practical industrial applications. With the development of simulation techniques, physical-knowledge based digital twin models give engineers access to a large amount of simulation data at a lower cost. These simulation data contain the physical characteristics and the degradation information of the component. In order to accurately predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) during the degradation process, in this paper, a bearing digital twin model is constructed based on a phenomenological vibration model. A Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) is used to achieve the domain adaptation target between the simulation and the real data. Regarding the simulation data as the source domain and the real data as the target domain, the DANN model is able to predict the RUL without any priori knowledge of the labelling information. Based on the validation results from real bearing run-to-failure experiments, the proposed method is able to get the minimum RUL prediction error compared against state-of-the-art methods.},

By taking advantage of the independence feature of each mode, we use the principle of unsupervised learning, making the training process of the deep neural network becomes the process of modal separation. A self-coding deep neural network is designed to identify the structural modal parameters from the vibration data of structures. The mixture signals, that is, the structural response data, are used as the input of the neural network. Then we use a complex loss function to restrict the training process of the neural network, making the output of the third layer the modal responses we want, and the weights of the last two layers are mode shapes. The deep neural network is essentially a nonlinear objective function optimization problem. A novel loss function is proposed to constrain the independent feature with consideration of uncorrelation and non-Gaussianity to restrict the designed neural network to obtain the structural modal parameters. A numerical example of a simple structure and an example of actual SHM data from a cable-stayed bridge are presented to illustrate the modal parameter identification ability of the proposed approach. The results show the approach's good capability in blindly extracting modal information from system responses.},

  abstract = {Large-scale wind turbine bearings including main bearings, gearbox bearings, generator bearings, blade bearings and yaw bearings, are critical components for wind turbines to convert kinetic wind energy into electrical energy. Unlike general-purpose industrial bearings, the loads and rotation speeds of wind turbine bearings change considerably because of dynamic wind flows. In the case of some extreme operating conditions, large-scale wind turbine bearings suffer excessive loads and they can be potentially damaged. Therefore, it is essential to develop reliable and cost-effective condition monitoring and fault diagnosis methods to assess the damage level and failure modes so that a proper maintenance plan can be designed. This paper aims at systematically and comprehensively summarizing current large-scale wind turbine bearing failure modes and condition monitoring and fault diagnosis achievements. Firstly, the representative failure modes of large-scale wind turbine bearings are reviewed in detail which can help to understand the causes and effects of the tribological issues of these bearings. Then, condition monitoring and fault diagnosis methods of large-scale wind turbine bearings are presented; within which failure modes, experimental scale and signal processing approaches are summarized. Finally, a number of popular condition monitoring and fault diagnosis approaches that can be potentially used for wind turbine bearings are reviewed, followed by a brief summary of future research directions for wind turbine bearing fault diagnosis.},

  abstract = {The early and accurate detection of rolling element bearing faults, which is closely linked to the timely maintenance and repair before a sudden breakdown, is still one of the key challenges in the area of condition monitoring. Nowadays in the frames of research advanced signal processing techniques are combined with high level machine learning approaches, focusing towards automatic fault diagnosis and decision making. A plethora of Health Indicators (HIs) have been proposed to feed in machine learning models in orderto track the system degradation. Cyclic Spectral Analysis (CSA), including Cyclic Spectral Correlation (CSC) and Cyclic Spectral Coherence (CSCoh), has been proved as a powerful tool for rotating machinery fault detection. Due to the periodic mechanism of bearing fault impacts, the HIs extracted from the Cyclostationary (CS) domain can detect bearing defects even in premature stage. On the other hand, supervised machine learning approaches with labelled training and testing datasets cannot be yet realistically applied in industrial applications. In order to overcome this limitation, a novel semi-supervised Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) with negative samples (NSVDD) fault detection approach is proposed in this paper. The NSVDD model utilizes CS indicators to build the feature space, and fits a hyper-sphere to calculate the Euclidean distances in order to isolate the healthy and faulty data. An uniform object generation method is adopted to generate artificial outliers as negative samples for the NSVDD. A systematic fault detection decision strategy is proposed to estimate the bearing status simultaneously with the detection of fault initiation. Furthermore, a multi-level anomaly detection framework is built based on data at i) single sensor level, ii) machine level and iii) entire machine fleet level. Three run-to-failure bearing datasets including signals from twelve bearings are used to implement the proposed fault detection methodology. Results show that, the CS based indicators outperform time indicators and Fast Kurtogram (FK) based Squared Envelope Spectrum (SES) indicators. Moreover, the proposed NSVDD model show superior characteristics in anomaly detection compared to three classification methodologies, i.e. the Back-Propagation Neural Network, the Random Forest and the K-Nearest Neighbour.},

A bearing phenomenological model is developed to generate simulated vibration signals. In the frame of domain adaptation transfer learning, a Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) is proposed utilizing the simulated data as the source domain. The DANN can align the coarse supervised source domain data and the fine supervised target domain data to conduct adversarial training. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can reach high classification accuracy using a small amount of real data. Compared to non-adapted and other transfer learning models, the proposed method demonstrates superior performance for bearing fault diagnosis, which is very promising for real industrial applications.},

This enables the first CWConv layer to discover more meaningful filters. Furthermore, only the scale parameter and translation parameter are directly learned from raw data at this CWConv layer. This provides a very effective way to obtain a customized filter bank, specifically tuned for extracting defectrelated impact component embedded in the vibration signal. In addition, three experimental verification using data from laboratory environment are carried out to verify effectiveness of the proposed method for mechanical fault diagnosis.

Because this transformation is highly non-linear, finding interpretations poses a significant challenge. In this paper we present an explainable deep one-class classification method, Fully Convolutional Data Description (FCDD), where the mapped samples are themselves also an explanation heatmap. FCDD yields competitive detection performance and provides reasonable explanations on common anomaly detection benchmarks with CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. On MVTec-AD, a recent manufacturing dataset offering ground-truth anomaly maps, FCDD sets a new state of the art in the unsupervised setting. Our method can incorporate ground-truth anomaly maps during training and using even a few of these ({\textasciitilde}5) improves performance significantly. Finally, using FCDD's explanations we demonstrate the vulnerability of deep one-class classification models to spurious image features such as image watermarks.},

In this paper, we provide a sober look at recent progress in the field and challenge some common assumptions. We first theoretically show that the unsupervised learning of disentangled representations is fundamentally impossible without inductive biases on both the models and the data. Then, we train more than 12 000 models covering most prominent methods and evaluation metrics in a reproducible large-scale experimental study on seven different data sets. We observe that while the different methods successfully enforce properties ``encouraged'' by the corresponding losses, well-disentangled models seemingly cannot be identified without supervision. Furthermore, increased disentanglement does not seem to lead to a decreased sample complexity of learning for downstream tasks. Our results suggest that future work on disentanglement learning should be explicit about the role of inductive biases and (implicit) supervision, investigate concrete benefits of enforcing disentanglement of the learned representations, and consider a reproducible experimental setup covering several data sets.},

(2019) demonstrated that unsupervised disentanglement learning without inductive biases is theoretically impossible and that existing inductive biases and unsupervised methods do not allow to consistently learn disentangled representations. However, in many practical settings, one might have access to a limited amount of supervision, for example through manual labeling of (some) factors of variation in a few training examples. In this paper, we investigate the impact of such supervision on state-of-the-art disentanglement methods and perform a large scale study, training over 52 000 models under well-defined and reproducible experimental conditions. We observe that a small number of labeled examples (0.01--0.5\% of the data set), with potentially imprecise and incomplete labels, is sufficient to perform model selection on state-of-the-art unsupervised models. Further, we investigate the benefit of incorporating supervision into the training process. Overall, we empirically validate that with little and imprecise supervision it is possible to reliably learn disentangled representations.},

The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

For many important real-world applications, these requirements are unfeasible and additional prior knowledge on the task domain is required to overcome the resulting problems. In particular, learning physics models for model-based control requires robust extrapolation from fewer samples - often collected online in real-time - and model errors may lead to drastic damages of the system. Directly incorporating physical insight has enabled us to obtain a novel deep model learning approach that extrapolates well while requiring fewer samples. As a first example, we propose Deep Lagrangian Networks (DeLaN) as a deep network structure upon which Lagrangian Mechanics have been imposed. DeLaN can learn the equations of motion of a mechanical system (i.e., system dynamics) with a deep network efficiently while ensuring physical plausibility. The resulting DeLaN network performs very well at robot tracking control. The proposed method did not only outperform previous model learning approaches at learning speed but exhibits substantially improved and more robust extrapolation to novel trajectories and learns online in real-time},

Firstly, the fractional Fourier transform based on curve feature segmentation is used to filter the fault vibration signal and extract the fault feature frequency. Then, the fault features are input into the SSA-DBN model for training, and the bearing fault features are classified, identified, and diagnosed. Finally, the rotating machinery fault simulator in the laboratory of Ottawa University is taken as the practical application object to verify the effectiveness of the method.

Automatic differentiation (AD) is a powerful tool to automate the calculation of derivatives and is preferable to more traditional methods, especially when differentiating complex algorithms and mathematical functions. The implementation of AD, however, requires some care to insure efficiency. Modern differentiation packages deploy a broad range of computational techniques to improve applicability, run time, and memory management. Among these techniques are operation overloading, region-based memory, and expression templates. There also exist several mathematical techniques which can yield high performance gains when applied to complex algorithms. For example, semi-analytical derivatives can reduce by orders of magnitude the runtime required to numerically solve and differentiate an algebraic equation.

The concept of cycle of reference (CoR) for cyclostationarity is presented. The possible causes of the well-used concept of slippage of the rolling-element bearing are explored to highlight the limitations of the cyclostationary theoretical framework. The influence of different types of jitters is presented to show the effect of using shaft cycle of reference on the spectral properties. CoR, on which bearing signals are phase locked so to restore their cyclostationarity, and a method to estimate the appropriate angle-time relationship are introduced. In a second part, original contributions on demodulation parameters and the possible introduction of unwanted artefacts are thoroughly explained along with the definition of a hypothesis test.

Even so, selecting the optimal window length for the Short-Time Fourier Transform remains a challenge. This work presents a procedure for adapting the Short Time Fourier Transform algorithm to be differentiable with respect to window length by using continuous window functions defined over the entire input signal duration. Thanks to this modification, a differentiable loss criterion can be defined to measure the Short-Time Fourier quality, and the gradient of the loss criterion with respect to window length can be computed. The optimal window length for a given loss criterion can then be efficiently solved for using a gradient-based optimization algorithm. Results from a simulated bearing dataset and three experimental bearing datasets are used to compare the optimal spectrograms obtained using different loss criteria. Specifically, a sparsity-based loss criterion is compared with two loss criteria inspired by the characteristic cyclo-stationarity nature of faults in rotating machinery. The results demonstrate the value of a continuous and differentiable window length selection method and highlight the importance of selecting appropriate loss criteria for defining STFT quality. Further, loss criteria that account for the cyclo-stationary nature of the signals are shown to be less likely to target single high-amplitude impulsive events compared to the sparsity-based loss criterion.},

However, in these data-driven approaches, engineering domain knowledge remains unexploited. Although engineering features are often used as inputs to machine learning models, thereby including domain knowledge, few methods exist for directly integrating domain knowledge about the expected machine fault behaviour into unsupervised fault detection methods. This paper presents a generic method for including domain knowledge into unsupervised, auto-encoder-based fault detection methods by regularising the Jacobian of the latent feature representation. This regularisation results in informative latent features that are sensitive to changes that are expected from a machine in a faulty condition. The proposed method is evaluated on a bearing fault detection task, both when using a low dimensional vector of engineering features and when using high dimensional frequency domain data. The analysis is conducted on two bearing fault data sets with different operating conditions, fault modes and signal-to-noise ratios. The proposed regularised auto-encoder yields improved ROC-AUC performance as compared to the unregularized baseline when evaluated on a latent-feature based fault indicator. The proposed method shows potential as a generic method for integrating engineering domain knowledge into fault detection problems.},

  abstract = {Fault detection methods for mechanical systems have diverse applications, such as detecting rotating machinery faults and identifying undesirable vehicle cabin acoustics. Supervised models are effective for this task, but rely on scarce training data from faulty conditions. As an alternative, semi-supervised methods trained on readily available reference data can be used, but these methods disregard fault detection domain knowledge from signal processing methods. In this paper it is proposed to enhance semi-supervised fault detection methods by leveraging signal processing gradients. The proposed method is based on a subspace detector, utilizing the singular value decomposition of signal processing gradients from reference conditions. Tests on three datasets show that the proposed method can outperform semi-supervised and signal processing baselines, especially in scenarios where imperfect signal processing assumptions were made. The results show future potential for using differentiable signal processing methods in semi-supervised fault detection.},

Hence, it does not specify the mechanism and reasons for its decision making. This aspect is considered a critical limitation of deep learning. This paper introduces another viewpoint, namely Bayesian deep learning. Deep learning can be installed in any framework, such as Bayesian networks and reinforcement learning. Subsequently, an expert can implement the knowledge as the graph structure, accelerate learning, and obtain new knowledge on the target domain. The framework is termed as the deep generative model. Conversely, we can directly introduce the Bayesian modeling approach to deep learning. Subsequently, it is possible to explore deep learning with respect to the confidence of its decision making via uncertainty quantification of the output and detect wrong decision-making or anomalous inputs. Given the aforementioned approaches, it is possible to adjust the ``brightness'' of deep learning.},

  abstract = {Rolling element bearing fault diagnostics has been a topic of intensive research in recent decades, as they are critical components of rotating machinery and therefore their failure may result in sudden breakdown of machines and industrial installations. The early and accurate detection of incipient faults on bearings can reduce the production cost by allowing maintenance engineers to schedule a replacement at the most convenient time. Envelope Analysis is a widespread powerful method in bearing diagnostics, often used along with Fast Kurtogram. However, the presence of ElectroMagnetic Interference (EMI) and generally speaking of impulsive and non gaussian noise, increases the complexity of bearing fault diagnosis and may lead to rather poor diagnostic performance. EMI is often present in mechanisms and machines, where motors are controlled by VariableFrequency Drives (VFD) and can present a vibration signature similar to that of bearing faults. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is the proposal of advanced signal processing techniques, which can detect bearing faults under the presence of strong ElectroMagnetic Interference or other impulsive noise (where state of the art methods fail). Two novel diagnostic methodologies are proposed based on the Cyclic Spectral Coherence (CSCoh). The integration of the CSCoh, over the full spectral frequency axis or over a specific spectral frequency band, results respectively in the Enhanced Envelope Spectrum or in the Improved Envelope Spectrum. The two novel diagnostic methodologies allow for the automatic selection and integration of the optimal bands on the CSCoh under heavy impulsive noise, such as EMI, resulting in a spectrum with enhanced characteristic bearing fault frequencies, without any human intervention required besides the knowledge of the characteristic fault frequency which is under investigation. The methods are applied on vibration data, captured on an epicyclic gearbox with seeded bearing faults, operating under the influence of strong EMI. The methods are tested and evaluated on different fault cases and achieve improved performance compared to state of the art diagnostic methodologies.},

  abstract = {Demodulation methods are widely used for bearing diagnostics, based often on the (Squared) Envelope Spectrum after band pass filtering. One of the main challenges of these methods is the detection of a suitable band for signal demodulation under varying speed conditions. Angular resampling methods may synchronize the impulsive nature of bearing damages with a certain periodicity, in the case of large speed fluctuations. On the other hand, the time-invariant carrier frequencies may spread over the broadband of the spectrum, making impossible the application of many band selection tools. Lately, focus has been targeted to cyclostationary-based tools, such as the Cyclic Spectral Correlation and the Cyclic Spectral Coherence, which achieve a high performance in detecting hidden cyclic periodicities. Initially, these methods have been represented in the Frequency-Frequency domain, however they have been extended, to the Order-Order and the Order-Frequency domains, to be able to describe signals under varying speed conditions. The integration of these bi-variable maps over a specific frequency band results to an equivalent to a demodulated spectrum. Therefore, the challenge is the selection of the proper integration band to obtain these demodulated spectra for bearing diagnostics. In this paper, a novel tool called the Improved Envelope Spectrum via Feature Optimization-gram (IESFOgram) is proposed as a band selection tool for the demodulation of the bi-variable map (CSC or CSCoh) for bearing diagnostics. The method is represented in a 1/3-binary tree and is applicable under constant and variable speed conditions. The methodology is tested and validated on real data captured on a laboratory planetary gearbox and on an aircraft engine gearbox, under both constant and varying speed conditions. Furthermore, the methodology is compared in terms of performance with the Fast Kurtogram and the Autogram-based methods.},

The proposed maximum correlated Kurtosis deconvolution method takes advantage of the periodic nature of the faults as well as the impulse-like vibration behaviour associated with most types of faults. The results are compared to the standard minimum entropy deconvolution method on both simulated and experimental data. The experimental data is from a gearbox with gear chip fault, and the results are compared between healthy and faulty vibrations. The results indicate that the proposed maximum correlated Kurtosis deconvolution method performs considerably better than the traditional minimum entropy deconvolution method, and often performs several times better at fault detection. In addition to this improved performance, deconvolution of separate fault periods is possible; allowing for concurrent fault detection. Finally, an online implementation is proposed and shown to perform well and be computationally achievable on a personal computer.},

  abstract = {Minimum Entropy Deconvolution (MED) has been applied successfully to rotating machine fault detection from vibration data, however this method has limitations. A convolution adjustment to the MED definition and solution is proposed in this paper to address the discontinuity at the start of the signal -- in some cases causing spurious impulses to be erroneously deconvolved. A problem with the MED solution is that it is an iterative selection process, and will not necessarily design an optimal filter for the posed problem. Additionally, the problem goal in MED prefers to deconvolve a single-impulse, while in rotating machine faults we expect one impulse-like vibration source per rotational period of the faulty element. Maximum Correlated Kurtosis Deconvolution was proposed to address some of these problems, and although it solves the target goal of multiple periodic impulses, it is still an iterative non-optimal solution to the posed problem and only solves for a limited set of impulses in a row. Ideally, the problem goal should target an impulse train as the output goal, and should directly solve for the optimal filter in a non-iterative manner. To meet these goals, we propose a non-iterative deconvolution approach called Multipoint Optimal Minimum Entropy Deconvolution Adjusted (MOMEDA). MOMEDA proposes a deconvolution problem with an infinite impulse train as the goal and the optimal filter solution can be solved for directly. From experimental data on a gearbox with and without a gear tooth chip, we show that MOMEDA and its deconvolution spectrums according to the period between the impulses can be used to detect faults and study the health of rotating machine elements effectively.},

The objective of this monitoring can be mainly split into two problems. A diagnostic problem, where normal data should be distinguished from anomalous data, otherwise called Anomaly Detection (AD), or a prognostic problem, where the aim is to predict the evolution of a Condition Indicator (CI) that reflects the condition of an asset throughout its life time. When considering machine condition monitoring, it is expected that this CI shows a monotonic behavior, as the condition of a machine gradually degrades over time. This work proposes an extension to Constraint Guided AutoEncoders (CGAE), which is a robust AD method, that enables building a single model that can be used for both AD and CI estimation. For the purpose of improved CI estimation the extension incorporates a constraint that enforces the model to have monotonically increasing CI predictions over time. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm performs similar, or slightly better, than CGAE, with regards to AD, while improving the monotonic behavior of the CI.},

  abstract = {Fault diagnosis is of significance for ensuring the safe and reliable operation of machinery equipment. Due to the heavy noise and interference, it is difficult to detect the fault directly from the measured signal. Hence, signal processing techniques that can achieve feature extraction, signal denoising, and fault identification are the most common tools in the field. Blind decon\- volution methods (BDMs), as one of the most classic methods, have been studied extensively and applied fully for machinery fault diagnosis. Up to now, plenty of publications about the studies and applications of BDMs for machinery fault diagnosis have been presented to academic jour\- nals, technical reports, and conference proceedings. This paper intends to survey and summarize the current progress of BDMs applied in machinery fault diagnosis, as well as provides a comprehensive review of BDMs from history to state-of-the-art methods and finally to research prospects. Firstly, the theoretical background and brief history of BDMs are introduced. Secondly, the modified BDMs are classified to review their basic principles. After that their merits and limitations as well as the performance analysis are summarized. Thirdly, the research and application on machinery fault detection using BDMs are overviewed. Finally, the prospects of BDMs in machinery fault diagnosis are discussed.},

  abstract = {Fault diagnosis is of significance for ensuring the safe and reliable operation of machinery equipment. Due to the heavy noise and interference, it is difficult to detect the fault directly from the measured signal. Hence, signal processing techniques that can achieve feature extraction, signal denoising, and fault identification are the most common tools in the field. Blind decon\- volution methods (BDMs), as one of the most classic methods, have been studied extensively and applied fully for machinery fault diagnosis. Up to now, plenty of publications about the studies and applications of BDMs for machinery fault diagnosis have been presented to academic jour\- nals, technical reports, and conference proceedings. This paper intends to survey and summarize the current progress of BDMs applied in machinery fault diagnosis, as well as provides a comprehensive review of BDMs from history to state-of-the-art methods and finally to research prospects. Firstly, the theoretical background and brief history of BDMs are introduced. Secondly, the modified BDMs are classified to review their basic principles. After that their merits and limitations as well as the performance analysis are summarized. Thirdly, the research and application on machinery fault detection using BDMs are overviewed. Finally, the prospects of BDMs in machinery fault diagnosis are discussed.},

  abstract = {As a key component in the machinery, the health of bearings directly affects working performance of machinery. Recently, many data-driven methods have been proposed to predict remaining useful life (RUL) of rolling bearings. However, most methods neglected the problem of data distribution difference caused by different operation conditions, which will lead to prediction performance deteriorating greatly on other bearings. To solve the domain shift problem in bearing RUL prediction, a sparse domain adaption network (SDAN) is proposed in this study. Firstly, an adaptive selection mechanism is proposed to select important input features in SDAN. Besides, a novel feature extractor, adaptively convolutional neural network (ACNN) is proposed to capture essential information from the selected features by adjusting receptive fields adaptively. The sparse feature se\- lection layer is developed to suppress noise and remove ineffective features based on the noise filtering of sparse representation. Besides, the sparse domain adaption is used in SDAN by integrating domain-adversarial leaning and unsupervised sparse domain alignment to solve the problem of data distribution shift. Finally, the effec\- tiveness of SDAN is verified on the PRONOSTIA rolling bearing dataset. The results demonstrate that SDAN can extract essential features and provide transferable RUL prediction performance under different working conditions.},

Our algorithm represents a scene using a fully-connected (nonconvolutional) deep network, whose input is a single continuous 5D coordinate (spatial location (x, y, z) and viewing direction ({\texttheta}, {$\varphi$})) and whose output is the volume density and view-dependent emitted radiance at that spatial location. We synthesize views by querying 5D coordinates along camera rays and use classic volume rendering techniques to project the output colors and densities into an image. Because volume rendering is naturally differentiable, the only input required to optimize our representation is a set of images with known camera poses. We describe how to effectively optimize neural radiance fields to render photorealistic novel views of scenes with complicated geometry and appearance, and demonstrate results that outperform prior work on neural rendering and view synthesis. View synthesis results are best viewed as videos, so we urge readers to view our supplementary video for convincing comparisons.},

  abstract = {There has been a recent resurgence in the area of explainable artificial intelligence as researchers and practitioners seek to make their algorithms more understandable. Much of this research is focused on explicitly explaining decisions or actions to a human observer, and it should not be controversial to say that looking at how humans explain to each other can serve as a useful starting point for explanation in artificial intelligence. However, it is fair to say that most work in explainable artificial intelligence uses only the researchers' intuition of what constitutes a `good' explanation. There exists vast and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science of how people define, generate, select, evaluate, and present explanations, which argues that people employ certain cognitive biases and social expectations towards the explanation process. This paper argues that the field of explainable artificial intelligence should build on this existing research, and reviews relevant papers from philosophy, cognitive psychology/science, and social psychology, which study these topics. It draws out some important findings, and discusses ways that these can be infused with work on explainable artificial intelligence.},

In efforts to achieve state-of-the-art model accuracy, researchers are employing increasingly complex machine learning algorithms that often outperform simple regressions in interpolative settings (               e.g.               random k-fold cross-validation) but suffer from poor extrapolation performance, portability, and human interpretability, which limits their potential for facilitating novel scientific insight. Here we examine the trade-off between model performance and interpretability across a broad range of science and engineering problems with an emphasis on materials science datasets. We compare the performance of black box random forest and neural network machine learning algorithms to that of single-feature linear regressions which are fitted using interpretable input features discovered by a simple random search algorithm. For interpolation problems, the average prediction errors of linear regressions were twice as high as those of black box models. Remarkably, when prediction tasks required extrapolation, linear models yielded average error only 5\% higher than that of black box models, and outperformed black box models in roughly 40\% of the tested prediction tasks, which suggests that they may be desirable over complex algorithms in many extrapolation problems because of their superior interpretability, computational overhead, and ease of use. The results challenge the common assumption that extrapolative models for scientific machine learning are constrained by an inherent trade-off between performance and interpretability.},

In this paper, we propose domain adapted neural networks (DANN) to explore how domain knowledge can be integrated into model training for deep networks. In particular, we incorporate loss terms for knowledge available as monotonicity constraints and approximation constraints. We evaluate our model on both synthetic data generated using the popular Bohachevsky function and a real-world dataset for predicting oxygen solubility in water. In both situations, we find that our DANN model outperforms its domain-agnostic counterpart yielding an overall mean performance improvement of 19.5\% with a worst- and best-case performance improvement of 4\% and 42.7\%, respectively.},

The safety and reliability improvement of ML models empowered by UQ has the potential to significantly facilitate the broad adoption of ML solutions in high-stakes decision settings, such as healthcare, manufacturing, and aviation, to name a few. In this tutorial, we aim to provide a holistic lens on emerging UQ methods for ML models with a particular focus on neural networks and the applications of these UQ methods in tackling engineering design as well as prognostics and health management problems. Toward this goal, we start with a comprehensive classification of uncertainty types, sources, and causes pertaining to UQ of ML models. Next, we provide a tutorial-style description of several state-of-the-art UQ methods: Gaussian process regression, Bayesian neural network, neural network ensemble, and deterministic UQ methods focusing on spectral-normalized neural Gaussian process. Established upon the mathematical formulations, we subsequently examine the soundness of these UQ methods quantitatively and qualitatively (by a toy regression example) to examine their strengths and shortcomings from different dimensions. Then, we review quantitative metrics commonly used to assess the quality of predictive uncertainty in classification and regression problems. Afterward, we discuss the increasingly important role of UQ of ML models in solving challenging problems in engineering design and health prognostics. Two case studies with source codes available on GitHub are used to demonstrate these UQ methods and compare their performance in the life prediction of lithium-ion batteries at the early stage (case study 1) and the remaining useful life prediction of turbofan engines (case study 2).},

Such an interpretable latent space enables the validation by expert defined rule sets. The evaluation of the DVAE is performed using the publicly available highD dataset for highway traffic scenarios. In comparison to a conventional variational autoencoder with equivalent complexity, the proposed model provides a similar prediction accuracy but with the great advantage of having an interpretable latent space. For crucial decision making and assessing trustworthiness of a prediction this property is highly desirable.},

Features extracted from amplitude demodulated vibration signals from both normal and faulty bearings were used to train HMMs to represent various bearing conditions. The features were based on the reflection coefficients of the polynomial transfer function of an autoregressive model of the vibration signals. Faults can be detected online by monitoring the probabilities of the pretrained HMM for the normal case given the features extracted from the vibration signals. The new technique also allows for diagnosis of the type of bearing fault by selecting the HMM with the highest probability. The new scheme was also adapted to diagnose multiple bearing faults. In this adapted scheme, features were based on the selected node energies of a wavelet packet decomposition of the vibration signal. For each fault, a different set of nodes, which correlates with the fault, is chosen. Both schemes were tested with experimental data collected from an accelerometer measuring the vibration from the drive-end ball bearing of an induction motor (Reliance Electric 2 HP IQPreAlert) driven mechanical system and have proven to be very accurate.},

In this paper, we show an avenue for aligning language models with user intent on a wide range of tasks by fine-tuning with human feedback. Starting with a set of labeler-written prompts and prompts submitted through the OpenAI API, we collect a dataset of labeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to fine-tune GPT-3 using supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model outputs, which we use to further fine-tune this supervised model using reinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the resulting models InstructGPT. In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters. Moreover, InstructGPT models show improvements in truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while having minimal performance regressions on public NLP datasets. Even though InstructGPT still makes simple mistakes, our results show that fine-tuning with human feedback is a promising direction for aligning language models with human intent.},

This paper presents the use of a scalogram and its mean frequency variation for the detection and monitoring of pitting faults in gears. Real gear vibrations are obtained from a test rig utilising a two-stage industrial gearbox. Pits representing differing degrees of fault severity are simulated on a few tooth surfaces. Classical processing schemes in the time and frequency domain are firstly employed to obtain general characteristics of the gear vibration. The continuous wavelet transform is then used to obtain a scalogram and its mean frequency variation. It has been found that the presence of a pitting fault cannot be clearly revealed by the time and frequency domain representations unless the fault severity is high. In contrast, the scalogram (and especially its mean frequency variation) provides early indications of presence and progression of pitting faults in gears even when the fault severity is considerably smaller.},

  abstract = {Although deep learning has been applied to successfully address many data mining problems, relatively limited work has been done on deep learning for anomaly detection. Existing deep anomaly detection methods, which focus on learning new feature representations to enable downstream anomaly detection methods, perform indirect optimization of anomaly scores, leading to data-inefficient learning and suboptimal anomaly scoring. Also, they are typically designed as unsupervised learning due to the lack of large-scale labeled anomaly data. As a result, they are difficult to leverage prior knowledge (e.g., a few labeled anomalies) when such information is available as in many real-world anomaly detection applications. This paper introduces a novel anomaly detection framework and its instantiation to address these problems. Instead of representation learning, our method fulfills an end-to-end learning of anomaly scores by a neural deviation learning, in which we leverage a few (e.g., multiple to dozens) labeled anomalies and a prior probability to enforce statistically significant deviations of the anomaly scores of anomalies from that of normal data objects in the upper tail. Extensive results show that our method can be trained substantially more data-efficiently and achieves significantly better anomaly scoring than state-of-the-art competing methods.},

However, existing unsupervised representation learning methods mainly focus on preserving the data regularity information and learning the representations independently of subsequent outlier detection methods, which can result in suboptimal and unstable performance of detecting irregularities (i.e., outliers). This paper introduces a ranking model-based framework, called RAMODO, to address this issue. RAMODO unifies representation learning and outlier detection to learn low-dimensional representations that are tailored for a state-of-the-art outlier detection approach - the random distance-based approach. This customized learning yields more optimal and stable representations for the targeted outlier detectors. Additionally, RAMODO can leverage little labeled data as prior knowledge to learn more expressive and application-relevant representations. We instantiate RAMODO to an efficient method called REPEN to demonstrate the performance of RAMODO.},

In this paper, we propose a new robust method for it based on improved wavelet packet decomposition (IWPD) and support vector data description (SVDD). A health index is designed based on general distance. Node energies of IWPD are used to compose feature vectors. Based on feature vectors extracted from normal signals, a SVDD model fitting a tight hypersphere around them is trained, the general distance of test data to this hypersphere is used as the health index. Research results of its application in a bearing accelerated life test show that this health index can reflect effectively bearing performance degradation comparing with many other parameters.},

In this paper, a two-step robust and understandable fault detection and diagnosis framework is developed to address this challenge by exploiting denoising sparse autoencoder and smooth integrated gradients. Specifically, denoising sparse autoencoder(DSAE) is utilized to detect faults in the first step. DSAE is more robust to noise corruption and has better generalization performance compared to the existing autoencoder-based methods. In the second step, smooth integrated gradients(SIG) is used to diagnose the root-cause variables of the faults detected. Smooth integrated gradients can provide a denoising effect on the feature importance. The proposed framework is evaluated through an application to the Tennessee Eastman process. As proved in the experiments, the presented DSAE-SIG method not only achieves higher diagnosis accuracy but also successfully identifies the potential root-cause variables of process disturbances.},

This research focuses on condition monitoring methods that use vibrations as the data source. These methods, used for detecting and diagnosing mechanical faults in wind turbines, utilise health indicators derived from time-domain or frequencydomain representations of vibration signals. This research focuses on statistical indicators, and there are many different ones. Furthermore, a set of features can be chosen for each of these statistical indicators, and the result is a health indicator for each combination of the features. This possibility of large amounts of possible indicators makes their calculation expensive in memory, storage, and processing. Therefore, there is a need for an automatic selection of the indicators that better predict faults without calculating all the existent indicators. This paper introduces the application of multi-armed bandit optimisation. This strategic decision-making framework balances exploring new methods with exploiting known ones to overcome these challenges. Specifically, the study employs a hybrid approach that combines stochastic bandits and continuum-armed bandits with Gaussian processes to refine the selection process by minimising fault detection errors. The research implements the well-known epsilon-greedy algorithm and introduces two novel hybrid bandit algorithms. This research used vast operational data from wind turbines to explore over 400 combinations of health indicators and their features to validate the efficacy of the proposed methods.},

Tradeoffs exist between unsupervised statistical methods, which are typically based on principal components analysis (PCA), and supervised ones, which are often based on Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and proponents for each approach exist in the remote sensing community. Recently, a combined approach known as subspace LDA has been proposed, where PCA is employed to recondition ill-posed LDA formulations. The key idea behind this approach is to use a PCA transformation as a preprocessor to discard the null space of rank-deficient scatter matrices, so that LDA can be applied on this reconditioned space. Thus, in theory, the subspace LDA technique benefits from the advantages of both methods. In this letter, we present a theoretical analysis of the effects (often ill effects) of PCA on the discrimination power of the projected subspace. The theoretical analysis is presented from a general pattern classification perspective for two possible scenarios: 1) when PCA is used as a simple dimensionality reduction tool and 2) when it is used to recondition an ill-posed LDA formulation. We also provide experimental evidence of the ineffectiveness of both scenarios for hyperspectral target recognition applications.},

Existing approaches such as deep autoencoder (DAE), variational autoencoder (VAE), conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) etc. have limited representation capabilities in the latent space and, hence, poor anomaly detection performance. Different models have to be trained for each different kind of machines to accurately perform the anomaly detection task. To solve this issue, we propose a new method named as hierarchical conditional variational autoencoder (HCVAE). This method utilizes available taxonomic hierarchical knowledge about industrial facility to refine the latent space representation. This knowledge helps model to improve the anomaly detection performance as well. We demonstrated the generalization capability of a single HCVAE model for different types of machines by using appropriate conditions. Additionally, to show the practicability of the proposed approach, (i) we evaluated HCVAE model on different domain and (ii) we checked the effect of partial hierarchical knowledge. Our results show that HCVAE method validates both of these points, and it outperforms the baseline system on anomaly detection task by utmost 15 \% on the AUC score metric.},

Taking convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as an example, which show excellent problem-solving capabilities in different fields of academia and industry, it still faces issues of enormous computing volume and complex mapping architecture. Based on the computing-in-memory property and parallel multiply accumulate (MAC) operations of the emerging nonvolatile memristor arrays, herein the recent research progress of the edge intelligence memristive convolution accelerator is summarized. Furthermore, aiming at improving memristive convolutional accelerators, two potential optimization schemes are also discussed: The compression methods represented by quantization show great potential for static image processing, and the combination of a CNN with a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network makes up for the CNN's shortcomings of dynamic target processing. Finally, the future challenges and opportunities of edge intelligence accelerators based on memristor arrays are also discussed.},

  abstract = {This tutorial is intended to guide the reader in the diagnostic analysis of acceleration signals from rolling element bearings, in particular in the presence of strong masking signals from other machine components such as gears. Rather than being a review of all the current literature on bearing diagnostics, its purpose is to explain the background for a very powerful procedure which is successful in the majority of cases. The latter contention is illustrated by the application to a number of very different case histories, from very low speed to very high speed machines. The specific characteristics of rolling element bearing signals are explained in great detail, in particular the fact that they are not periodic, but stochastic, a fact which allows them to be separated from deterministic signals such as from gears. They can be modelled as cyclostationary for some purposes, but are in fact not strictly cyclostationary (at least for localised defects) so the term pseudo-cyclostationary has been coined. An appendix on cyclostationarity is included. A number of techniques are described for the separation, of which the discrete/random separation (DRS) method is usually most efficient. This sometimes requires the effects of small speed fluctuations to be removed in advance, which can be achieved by order tracking, and so this topic is also amplified in an appendix. Signals from localised faults in bearings are impulsive, at least at the source, so techniques are described to identify the frequency bands in which this impulsivity is most marked, using spectral kurtosis. For very high speed bearings, the impulse responses elicited by the sharp impacts in the bearings may have a comparable length to their separation, and the minimum entropy deconvolution technique may be found useful to remove the smearing effects of the (unknown) transmission path. The final diagnosis is based on ``envelope analysis'' of the optimally filtered signal, but despite the fact that this technique has been used for 40 years in analogue form, the advantages of more recent digital implementations are explained.},

Nonetheless, the current domain adaptation methods only concentrate on the data distributions and ignore the feature gradient distributions, leading to some samples being misclassified due to large gradient discrepancies, thus affecting diagnosis performance. In this paper, a gradient aligned domain adversarial network (GADAN) is proposed. First, the discrepancies of the marginal and condi\- tional distribution between the source and target domain are reduced by minimizing the joint maximum mean discrepancy. Then, a pseudo-labeling approach based on a clustering self-supervised strategy is utilized to attain high-quality pseudo-labels of target domains, and most importantly in the dimension of the data gradient, the feature gradient distributions are aligned by adversarial learning to further reduce the domain shift, even if the distributions of the two domains are close enough. Finally, experiments and engineering applications demon\- strate the effectiveness and superiority of GADAN for transfer diagnosis between various working conditions or different machines.},

Existing autoencoder-based (AE-based) fault detection methods did not address the effects of speed variations, and thus leave room for improvement at varying speed conditions. This paper proposes a new deep learning model named speed normalized autoencoder (SN-AE). The SN-AE consists of a speed normalization (SN) branch and an AE branch. The SN branch takes the speed signal as the input and automatically learns an SN function which normalizes the vibration signal to remove the effects of speed variations. Thereafter, the normalized vibration signal is inputted to the AE branch for fault detection. Case studies were conducted to detect incipient faults of three typical rotating machines including a planetary gearbox, a fixed-shaft gearbox and a rolling element bearing under varying speed conditions. Results have shown that the proposed SN-AE successfully removes the effects of speed variations and achieves significantly better detection performances than existing AE-based fault detection methods.},

However, both linearity of the underlying SS model and accurate knowledge of it are often not encountered in practice. Here, we present KalmanNet, a real-time state estimator that learns from data to carry out Kalman filtering under non-linear dynamics with partial information. By incorporating the structural SS model with a dedicated recurrent neural network module in the flow of the KF, we retain data efficiency and interpretability of the classic algorithm while implicitly learning complex dynamics from data.

  abstract = {Improving the reliability of engineered systems is a crucial problem in many applications in various engineering fields, such as aerospace, nuclear energy, and water declination industries. This requires efficient and effective system health monitoring methods, including processing and analyzing massive machinery data to detect anomalies and performing diagnosis and prognosis. In recent years, deep learning has been a fast-growing field and has shown promising results for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) in interpreting condition monitoring signals such as vibration, acoustic emission, and pressure due to its capacity to mine complex representations from raw data. This paper provides a systematic review of state-of-the-art deep learning-based PHM frameworks. It emphasizes on the most recent trends within the field and presents the benefits and potentials of state-of-the-art deep neural networks for system health management. In addition, limitations and challenges of the existing technologies are discussed, which leads to opportunities for future research.},

We show that by adding a well chosen penalty term to the classical reconstruction cost function, we can achieve results that equal or surpass those attained by other regularized auto-encoders as well as denoising auto-encoders on a range of datasets. This penalty term corresponds to the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian matrix of the encoder activations with respect to the input. We show that this penalty term results in a localized space contraction which in turn yields robust features on the activation layer. Furthermore, we show how this penalty term is related to both regularized auto-encoders and denoising auto-encoders and how it can be seen as a link between deterministic and non-deterministic auto-encoders. We find empirically that this penalty helps to carve a representation that better captures the local directions of variation dictated by the data, corresponding to a lower-dimensional non-linear manifold, while being more invariant to the vast majority of directions orthogonal to the manifold. Finally, we show that by using the learned features to initialize a MLP, we achieve state of the art classification error on a range of datasets, surpassing other methods of pretraining.},

We explicitly encourage the latent representation to contract the input space by regularizing the norm of the Jacobian (analytically) and the Hessian (stochastically) of the encoder's output with respect to its input, at the training points. While the penalty on the Jacobian's norm ensures robustness to tiny corruption of samples in the input space, constraining the norm of the Hessian extends this robustness when moving further away from the sample. From a manifold learning perspective, balancing this regularization with the auto-encoder's reconstruction objective yields a representation that varies most when moving along the data manifold in input space, and is most insensitive in directions orthogonal to the manifold. The second order regularization, using the Hessian, penalizes curvature, and thus favors smooth manifold. We show that our proposed technique, while remaining computationally efficient, yields representations that are significantly better suited for initializing deep architectures than previously proposed approaches, beating state-of-the-art performance on a number of datasets.},

  abstract = {Ecological ``niche modeling'' using presence-only locality data and large-scale environmental variables provides a powerful tool for identifying and mapping suitable habitat for species over large spatial extents. We describe a niche modeling approach that identifies a minimum (rather than an optimum) set of basic habitat requirements for a species, based on the assumption that constant environmental relationships in a species' distribution (i.e., variables that maintain a consistent value where the species occurs) are most likely to be associated with limiting factors. Environmental variables that take on a wide range of values where a species occurs are less informative because they do not limit a species' distribution, at least over the range of variation sampled. This approach is operationalized by partitioning Mahalanobis D2 (standardized difference between values of a set of environmental variables for any point and mean values for those same variables calculated from all points at which a species was detected) into independent components. The smallest of these components represents the linear combination of variables with minimum variance; increasingly larger components represent larger variances and are increasingly less limiting. We illustrate this approach using the California Gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica Brewster) and provide SAS code to implement it.},

Typically anomaly detection is treated as an unsupervised learning problem. In practice however, one may have---in addition to a large set of unlabeled samples---access to a small pool of labeled samples, e.g. a subset verified by some domain expert as being normal or anomalous. Semi-supervised approaches to anomaly detection aim to utilize such labeled samples, but most proposed methods are limited to merely including labeled normal samples. Only a few methods take advantage of labeled anomalies, with existing deep approaches being domain-specific. In this work we present Deep SAD, an end-to-end deep methodology for general semi-supervised anomaly detection. We further introduce an information-theoretic framework for deep anomaly detection based on the idea that the entropy of the latent distribution for normal data should be lower than the entropy of the anomalous distribution, which can serve as a theoretical interpretation for our method. In extensive experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10, along with other anomaly detection benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our method is on par or outperforms shallow, hybrid, and deep competitors, yielding appreciable performance improvements even when provided with only little labeled data.},

However, due to the changes in the mechanical operating environment and the application of new sensors in real work, the effect of the training model is not ideal in field applications. The key of this problem is the deviation of feature space mapping between training source domain and application target domain. This paper proposes an unsupervised adversarial domain adaptive fault diagnosis transfer learning model based on the minimum domain spacing to reduce the deviation. In adversarial network training, by training the weight parameters of the classifier, some features extracted by the composed classifier are added to the feature distribution of the target domain through weight changes, which reduces the feature distribution difference between the source domain and the target domain. It is reflected on the reduction of the maximum mean difference distance (MMD) between the two domains, and the fitting features of the data distribution are improved. Finally, through two experimental platforms of rolling bearing and planetary gearbox dataset, the results of six diagnostic tasks show that the new model reduces the amount of parameters by 33.66\% and keeps accuracy more than 99\% compared with the DANN model under the condition.},

Since gear damage usually results from tooth contact, data for reliable fault detection should be acquired as close as possible to this engagement to reduce other components' disturbances (such as vibrations). One typical gear damage mechanism is pitting. Although the detection of gear pitting using acceleration data is already covered in research, methods with integrated sensors and electronics into the gear (in-situ) are still in their infancy. Most fault detection approaches still rely on external high-performance measurement systems unsuitable for in-situ integration. Thus, this paper proposes an algorithm pipeline for detecting gear pitting using acceleration data suitable for low-power embedded devices, such as Microcontrollers (MCUs). Downsampling provides the minimum required acceleration data sample rate necessary for detection. It is the basis for future work on suitable sensor and hardware selection.

Although existing deep learning approaches are able to intelligently detect and classify the faults in bearings, they still face one or both of the following challenges: (i) most of these approaches rely exclusively on data and do not incorporate physical knowledge into the learning and prediction processes; and (ii) the approaches often focus on the fault diagnosis of a single bearing in a rotating machine, while in reality a rotating machine may contain multiple bearings. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel approach, namely physics-based convolutional neural network (PCNN), for fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings. In PCNN, an exclusively data-driven deep learning approach, called convolutional neural network, is carefully modified to incorporate useful information from physical knowledge about bearings and their fault characteristics. To this end, the proposed approach (1) utilizes spectral kurtosis and envelope analysis to extract sidebands from raw sensor signals and minimize non-transient components of the signals and (2) feeds the information about the fault characteristics into the CNN model. With the capability to process signals from multiple sensors, the proposed PCNN approach is capable of concurrently monitoring multiple bearings and detecting faults in these bearings. The performance of PCNN in machinery fault diagnosis is compared with that of traditional machine learning- and deep learning-based approaches reported in the literature.},

  abstract = {Spectral kurtosis (SK) represents a valuable tool for extracting transients buried in noise, which makes it very powerful for the diagnostics of rolling element bearings. However, a high value of SK requires that the individual transients are separated, which in turn means that if their repetition rate is high their damping must be sufficiently high that each dies away before the appearance of the next. This paper presents an algorithm for enhancing the surveillance capability of SK by using the minimum entropy deconvolution (MED) technique. The MED technique effectively deconvolves the effect of the transmission path and clarifies the impulses, even where they are not separated in the original signal. The paper illustrates these issues by analysing signals taken from a high-speed test rig, which contained a bearing with a spalled inner race. The results show that the use of the MED technique dramatically sharpens the pulses originating from the impacts of the balls with the spall and increases the kurtosis values to a level that reflects the severity of the fault. Moreover, when the algorithm was tested on signals taken from a gearbox for a bearing with a spalled outer race, it shows that each of the impulses originating from the impacts is made up of two parts (corresponding to entry into and exit from the spall). This agrees well with the literature but is often difficult to observe without the use of the MED technique. The use of the MED along with SK analysis also greatly improves the results of envelope analysis for making a complete diagnosis of the fault and trending its progression.},

  abstract = {To date, almost all experimental evaluations of machine learning-based recognition algorithms in computer vision have taken the form of ``closed set'' recognition, whereby all testing classes are known at training time. A more realistic scenario for vision applications is ``open set'' recognition, where incomplete knowledge of the world is present at training time, and unknown classes can be submitted to an algorithm during testing. This paper explores the nature of open set recognition and formalizes its definition as a constrained minimization problem. The open set recognition problem is not well addressed by existing algorithms because it requires strong generalization. As a step toward a solution, we introduce a novel ``1-vs-set machine,'' which sculpts a decision space from the marginal distances of a 1-class or binary SVM with a linear kernel. This methodology applies to several different applications in computer vision where open set recognition is a challenging problem, including object recognition and face verification. We consider both in this work, with large scale cross-dataset experiments performed over the Caltech 256 and ImageNet sets, as well as face matching experiments performed over the Labeled Faces in the Wild set. The experiments highlight the effectiveness of machines adapted for open set evaluation compared to existing 1-class and binary SVMs for the same tasks.},

  abstract = {We study the classical problem of recovering a multidimensional source signal from observations of nonlinear mixtures of this signal. We show that this recovery is possible (up to a permutation and monotone scaling of the source's original component signals) if the mixture is due to a sufficiently differentiable and invertible but otherwise arbitrarily nonlinear function and the component signals of the source are statistically independent with `non-degenerate' second-order statistics. The latter assumption requires the source signal to meet one of three regularity conditions which essentially ensure that the source is sufficiently far away from the non-recoverable extremes of being deterministic or constant in time. These assumptions, which cover many popular time series models and stochastic processes, allow us to reformulate the initial problem of nonlinear blind source separation as a simple-to-state problem of optimisation-based function approximation. We propose to solve this approximation problem by minimizing a novel type of objective function that efficiently quantifies the mutual statistical dependence between multiple stochastic processes via cumulant-like statistics. This yields a scalable and direct new method for nonlinear Independent Component Analysis with widely applicable theoretical guarantees and for which our experiments indicate good performance.},

A method is introduced that is able to extract dynamic information from flow fields that are either generated by a (direct) numerical simulation or visualized/measured in a physical experiment. The extracted dynamic modes, which can be interpreted as a generalization of global stability modes, can be used to describe the underlying physical mechanisms captured in the data sequence or to project large-scale problems onto a dynamical system of significantly fewer degrees of freedom. The concentration on subdomains of the flow field where relevant dynamics is expected allows the dissection of a complex flow into regions of localized instability phenomena and further illustrates the flexibility of the method, as does the description of the dynamics within a spatial framework. Demonstrations of the method are presented consisting of a plane channel flow, flow over a two-dimensional cavity, wake flow behind a flexible membrane and a jet passing between two cylinders.},

Blind and targeted features can be used to guide the frequency band selection process. Blind features' performance is impeded when there are dominant non-stationary extraneous components, whereas targeted features' performance is impeded when the characteristic frequency of the machine component is unknown, erroneously estimated or the damaged component is not targeted. An anomalous frequency band identification method is proposed that utilises the available historical data to detect weak damage components that deviate from the baseline or reference condition. This makes it possible to ignore dominant extraneous components that are also present in the historical dataset.

Hence, in this work we propose a methodology that combines the order-frequency spectral coherence with historical data that were acquired from a healthy machine to obtain an anomalous envelope spectrum, which is further processed for fault diagnosis. This anomalous envelope spectrum is further processed with a smoothing operation to not only perform automatic fault detection, but it is also possible to identify the damaged component if the kinematics of the gearbox are known.

  abstract = {Incipient damage detection is important for critical rotating machines such as gearboxes found in the power generation, mining and aeronautical industries. However, the fault information frequently manifests in weak frequency bands in the vibration signals and the fault diagnosis process is impeded by time-varying operating conditions. Frequency band identification methods can be used to enhance the weak fault information in the vibration signal, however, this process is impeded by impulsive components unrelated to the component-ofinterest and time-varying operating conditions. Hence, in this work, an optimisation-based frequency band identification method is developed to address these shortcomings. This method comprises of two steps; in the first step, a coarse informative frequency band procedure is used, whereafter a derivative-free optimisation algorithm is utilised to find the optimal frequency band for fault diagnosis. Since many rotating machines operate for long periods of time in a healthy condition, much healthy historical data are usually available when continuous monitoring is performed. Hence, this historical data are used with the proposed frequency band identification approach for automatic fault detection. The method is investigated on two experimental datasets acquired under time-varying operating conditions and compared to other existing approaches for fault diagnosis. The results indicate that the method is very capable of enhancing the fault information and can be used for automatic fault detection under time-varying operating conditions.},

Rolling element bearing component failures are important causes of gearbox failures and therefore robust bearing diagnostic techniques are required. In this paper, a rolling element bearing diagnostic methodology based on novelty detection is proposed for machines operating under variable speed conditions. The methodology uses the wavelet packet transform, order tracking and a feature modelling approach to generate a diagnostic metric in the form of a discrepancy measure. The probability distribution of the diagnostic metric, statistically conditioned on the corresponding operating conditions is estimated, whereafter the condition of the rolling bearing element is inferred. The rolling element bearing diagnostic methodology is validated on data from a phenomenological gearbox model and two experimental datasets.},

This process involves optimising a derived objective function from a defined objective. The objectives are often based on proxy health indicators to determine the filter's parameters. However, these indicators can be compromised by irrelevant extraneous signal components and fluctuating operational conditions, affecting the filter's efficacy. Fault detection primarily uses the fault component's prominence in the envelope spectrum, quantified by an envelope spectrum-based signal-to-noise ratio. New optimal filter objective functions are derived from the proposed generalised envelope spectrumbased signal-to-noise objective for machines operating under variable speed conditions. Instead of optimising proxy health indicators, the optimal filter coefficients of the formulation directly maximise the envelope spectrum-based signal-to-noise ratio over targeted frequency bands using standard gradient-based optimisers. Four derived objective functions from the proposed objective effectively outperform five prominent methods in tests on three experimental datasets.},

Some rotating machines (e.g. wind turbines) operate inherently under timevarying operating conditions, however, very few frequency band identification methods have been developed with varying operating conditions in mind. Therefore, in this work, a systematic framework for obtaining consistent feature planes under time-varying operating conditions is proposed. This framework utilises the angle-frequency instantaneous power spectrum and the order-frequency cyclic modulation spectrum to construct feature planes. The kurtogram, the sparsogram, the infogram, the ICS2gram and the log-cycligram are obtained on numerical and experimental datasets acquired under time-varying operating conditions using this framework. In addition to this, we also implement the Informative Frequency Band Identification method using targeted cyclic orders, abbreviated to IFBIagram, in this framework and compare the performance of this method against the other frequency band identification methods. Ultimately, we found that the feature used in the construction of the IFBIagram is very well-suited for gear and bearing fault diagnosis under time-varying operating conditions.},

  abstract = {Performing condition monitoring on rotating machines which operate under fluctuating conditions remains a challenge, with robust diagnostic techniques being required for the condition inference task. Some of the developed diagnostic techniques rely on the availability of historical fault data, which is impractical or even impossible to obtain in many circumstances and therefore novelty detection techniques such as discrepancy analysis are used. However, discrepancy analysis assumes that the condition of the machine is the same throughout the signal in the model optimisation process i.e. no localised damage is present, which can pose problems if the training data unwittingly contain a component with localised damage. In this paper, an automatic procedure is proposed for diagnosing localised gear damage in the presence of fluctuating operating conditions, with no historical data being required to model the data used in the condition inference process. The continuous wavelet transform, principal component analysis and information theory are used to obtain divergence data of the gear under consideration. The divergence data are used with Bayesian data analysis techniques to automatically infer the presence of localised anomalies due to localised gear damage. The proposed technique is validated in two experimental investigations, with promising results being obtained.},

There are many potential signal processing and analysis techniques that can be utilised to diagnose the machine from the condition monitoring data, however, they seldom incorporate the available healthy historical data of a machine systematically in the fault diagnosis process. Hence, a methodology is proposed in this article which supplements the orderfrequency spectral coherence with historical data from a healthy machine to perform automatic fault detection, automatic fault localisation and fault trending. This has the benefit that the order-frequency spectral coherence, a very powerful technique for rotating machine fault diagnosis under varying speed conditions, can be utilised without requiring an expert to interpret the results. In this methodology, an extended version of the improved envelope spectrum is utilised to extract features from the orderfrequency spectral coherence, whereafter a probabilistic model is carefully used to calculate a diagnostic metric for automatic fault detection and localisation. The methodology is investigated on numerical gearbox data as well as experimental gearbox data, both acquired under time-varying operating conditions with two probabilistic models, namely a Gaussian model and a kernel density estimator, compared as well.

Hence, novelty detection techniques such as discrepancy analysis are useful because only healthy historical data are required. However, even if discrepancy analysis is implemented on a machine, some historical fault data will become available during the operational lifetime of the machine and could be utilised to improve the efficiency of the condition inference process. An open set recognition methodology relying on discrepancy analysis is proposed that is capable of detecting novelties when only healthy historical data are available. It is also capable of inferring the condition of the machine if historical fault data are available and it is further able to detect novelties in regions not well supported by the historical fault data. In the condition recognition procedure, Gaussian mixture models are used with Bayes' rule and a decision rule to infer the condition of the machine in an open set recognition framework, where it is emphasised that it is beneficial to use the complete datasets (i.e. data acquired throughout the life of the component) for optimising the models. The benefit of the open set recognition model is that it is easy to incorporate new historical data in the framework as the data become available. In this work, practical aspects of the condition inference process such as the importance of good decision boundaries are highlighted and discussed as well. The methodology is validated on a synthetic dataset and experimental datasets acquired under varying operating conditions and it is also compared to a conventional classification process where discrepancy analysis is not used.

  abstract = {Supervised deep learning approaches to underdetermined audio source separation achieve state-of-the-art performance but require a dataset of mixtures along with their corresponding isolated source signals. Such datasets can be extremely costly to obtain for musical mixtures. This raises a need for unsupervised methods. We propose a novel unsupervised modelbased deep learning approach to musical source separation. Each source is modelled with a differentiable parametric sourcefilter model. A neural network is trained to reconstruct the observed mixture as a sum of the sources by estimating the source models' parameters given their fundamental frequencies. At test time, soft masks are obtained from the synthesized source signals. The experimental evaluation on a vocal ensemble separation task shows that the proposed method outperforms learning-free methods based on nonnegative matrix factorization and a supervised deep learning baseline. Integrating domain knowledge in the form of source models into a data-driven method leads to high data efficiency: the proposed approach achieves good separation quality even when trained on less than three minutes of audio. This work makes powerful deep learning based separation usable in scenarios where training data with ground truth is expensive or nonexistent.},

  abstract = {In recent years, advances in computer technology and the emergence of big data have enabled deep learning to achieve impressive successes in bearing condition monitoring and fault detection. While existing deep learning approaches are able to efficiently detect and classify bearing faults, most of these approaches depend exclusively on data and do not incorporate physical knowledge into the learning and prediction processes---or more importantly, embed the physical knowledge of bearing faults into the model training process, which makes the model physically meaningful. To address this challenge, we propose a physics-informed deep learning approach that consists of a simple threshold model and a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model for bearing fault detection. In the proposed physics-informed deep learning approach, the threshold model first assesses the health classes of bearings based on known physics of bearing faults. Then, the CNN model automatically extracts high-level characteristic features from the input data and makes full use of these features to predict the health class of a bearing. We designed a loss function for training and validating the CNN model that selectively amplifies the effect of the physical knowledge assimilated by the threshold model when embedding this knowledge into the CNN model. The proposed physics-informed deep learning approach was validated using (1) data from 18 bearings on an agricultural machine operating in the field, and (2) data from bearings on a laboratory test stand in the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) Bearing Data Center.},

The continuous recording of physical parameters allows effective analysis of the operational status of the monitored system and prediction of unknown risks. Thanks to the development of deep learning, the ability to analyze temporal signals collected by sensors has been greatly improved. However, models trained in the source domain do not perform well in the target domain due to the presence of domain gaps. In recent years, many researchers have used deep unsupervised domain adaptation techniques to address the domain gap between signals collected by sensors in different scenarios, i.e., using labeled data in the source domain and unlabeled data in the target domain to improve the performance of models in the target domain. This survey first summarizes the background of recent research on unsupervised domain adaptation with time series sensor data, the types of sensors used, the domain gap between the source and target domains, and commonly used datasets. Then, the paper classifies and compares different unsupervised domain adaptation methods according to the way of adaptation and summarizes different adaptation settings based on the number of source and target domains. Finally, this survey discusses the challenges of the current research and provides an outlook on future work. This survey systematically reviews and summarizes recent research on unsupervised domain adaptation for time series sensor data to provide the reader with a systematic understanding of the field.},

  abstract = {Real-time structural damage detection is one of the main goals of establishing an effective structural health monitoring system. However, due to the lack of training data for possible damage patterns, supervised methods tend to be difficult for such applications. This article therefore proposes a novel unsupervised real-time damage detection method using machine learning, which consists of a statistical modeling approach using neural networks and a decision-making process using deep support vector domain description. To choose an optimal window length while extracting damage-sensitive features, an iterative training strategy is proposed to remove redundant samples from an oversized window. The proposed method is then verified using a simulated dataset from the International Association for Structural Control--American Society of Civil Engineering benchmark and an experimental dataset from shake table tests. The results show that the mean alarm density can be used as an indicator of damage existence and damage levels for the single-sensor approach. Higher performance of damage detection and lower performance of identifying damage levels are observed for the multi-sensor approach when the rotational modes are amplified by asymmetric damage patterns. The results of mean false alarm density show that the presented method has a low probability of generating false alarms. The effectiveness of iterative pruning strategy is observed through the visualization of loss function and weights in the neural networks. Finally, the capability of real-time execution of the proposed damage detection method is investigated and verified. As a result, trained with healthy data only, the proposed method is effective in detecting damage existence and damage levels.},

Simple classical models are useful but sensitive to inaccuracies and may lead to poor performance when real systems display complex or dynamic behavior. On the other hand, purely data-driven approaches that are model-agnostic are becoming increasingly popular as data sets become abundant and the power of modern deep learning pipelines increases. Deep neural networks (DNNs) use generic architectures which learn to operate from data, and demonstrate excellent performance, especially for supervised problems.

  abstract = {Over the years, informative frequency band (IFB) identification techniques emerged with the aim of guaranteeing optimal demodulation-band for the diagnostics of rotating machinery. A measured vibration signal from complex rotating machinery, such as a gearbox system, invariantly exhibits heavy and impulsive background noises. As a result, robust IFB identification methods are needed to adapt to these background noises. In this context, a notion of spectral log-meanexp sparsity measure using exponential function-based quasi-arithmetic mean is coined and the synchronous median instantaneous power spectrum-gram (SM-IPSgram) is proposed as an IFB identification method for gear diagnostics. The spectral log-mean-exp satisfies at least five of six criteria that are necessary for the measurement of sparsity, and its performance is comparable to that of the classical (but powerful) sparsity measures. On the other hand, the SM-IPSgram has some very attractive properties, viz: (i) it is computationally efficient, (ii) extremely robust, (iii) can cope with all kinds of background noises, e.g. strong cyclostationary interferences, Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise, and (iv) it produces a filter banks decomposition to accentuate only the carrier/spectral frequency of the defect, and thus gives much earlier warning of abnormal conditions. Eventually, the experimental and numerical results are reported to corroborate the effectiveness of the SM-IPSgram estimation of the spectral log-mean-exp, and its intrinsic properties are pointed out and compared to other advanced methods in the literature.},

  abstract = {The demodulation of machine signals is a key step for the diagnostics and prognostics of components such as rolling element bearings. Whereas diagnostic approaches could perform a cyclostationary analysis over the full spectral band (i.e. using cyclic-spectral maps), in order to extract time domain and statistical features for prognostics, a pre-processing filtering step is required to extract the often-weak fault-symptomatic signal components. A series of techniques derived from the original idea of the kurtogram have been proposed in previous studies for the selection of this optimal demodulation band. All of these methodologies have been designed to identify signal components with high impulsiveness (nonGaussianity) or strong second-order cyclostationarity, both assumed to be typical characteristics of bearing fault signals. However, a recent series of theoretical works has shown how non-Gaussianity and non-stationarity (in its cyclic form), despite being clearly distinct properties, are practically entangled in bearing signals, and can be easily confused by indices such as kurtosis (implicitly assuming stationarity) or second-order cyclostationary (CS2) indicators (implicitly assuming Gaussianity). In addition, it has been shown that generalised Gaussian cyclostationary models are effective tools to describe and separate these two properties in bearing signals. Partial evidence seems to show that the cyclostationary property is dominant and more clearly indicative of a bearing fault, whereas impulsiveness is potentially misleading and not uniquely attributable to the bearing component of the signal. In this paper, we therefore propose a new statistically robust band selection tool which can capture cyclostationarity separately from non-Gaussianity. The tool, coined the log-cycligram (LC), is based on the strength of target cyclic frequency components in the spectrum of the log envelope (LES), and so potential fault frequencies must be known in advance. The effectiveness of the method is validated against the traditional kurtogram and a range of other existing techniques on both numerical and experimental datasets.},

There is, then, a clear need to examine the data thoroughly and to categorise it appropriately, and this paper intends to fulfil that objective. To do so, three established diagnostic techniques are applied to the entire CWRU data set, and the diagnostic outcomes are provided and discussed in detail. Recommendations are given as to how the data might best be used, and also on how any future benchmark data should be generated. Though intended primarily as a benchmark to aid in testing new diagnostic algorithms, it is also hoped that much of the discussion will have broader applicability to other bearing diagnostics cases.},

We investigate two such estimators based on two equivalent representations of the FIM --- both unbiased and consistent.

Such methods have been prevalent in the Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) anomaly detection literature. While DR is favorable in supervised anomaly detection, where possible novelties are known a priori, the efficacy is less clear in unsupervised detection. In this work, we perform a detailed assessment of the DR performance trade-offs to determine whether the information loss imposed by DR can impact SHM performance for previously unseen novelties. As a basis for our analysis, we rely on an SHM anomaly detection method operating on input signals' fast Fourier transform (FFT). FFT is regarded as a raw, frequency-domain feature that allows studying various DR techniques. We design extensive experiments comparing various DR techniques, including neural autoencoder models, to capture the impact on two SHM benchmark datasets exclusively. Results imply the loss of information to be more detrimental, reducing the novelty detection accuracy by up to 60\% with autoencoder-based DR. Regularization can alleviate some of the challenges though unpredictable. Dimensions of substantial vibrational information mostly survive DR; thus, the regularization impact suggests that these dimensions are not reliable damage-sensitive features regarding unseen faults. Consequently, we argue that designing new SHM anomaly detection methods that can work with high-dimensional raw features is a necessary research direction and present open challenges and future directions.},

The number of PCs that gives the maximum sensitivity is easily determined for sensor faults by examining the Fault SNR. If a priori data is available, that is, operation data measured during faulty conditions, optimization of the number of PCs for the process fault is also possible. In a case where a priori information of the fault is not available, monitoring multiple models with various numbers of PCs in parallel is considered the next best strategy.},

  abstract = {The conventional method of detecting a gear fault is to demodulate the vibration signal collected from the gearbox based on the Hilbert transform; however, this requires human intervention and lacks sophistication. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is a significant timefrequency tool for adaptively decomposing vibration signals into a collection of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs); a fault feature can be extracted from one of IMFs to reveal the fault location and fault level of a gear or bearing in the mechanical drive system. In this paper, a multi-harmonic vibration model of a gearbox with fault modulation is presented, a conventional demodulation analysis using Hilbert transform is introduced, and the principle of EMD is illustrated. The Hilbert demodulation analysis and EMD are applied to processing field vibration signals collected from a wind turbine gearbox to detect a gear-pitting fault. The results show that EMD can extract the fault modulation information more adaptively and intelligently than Hilbert demodulation analysis can.},

Alternatively, complex data can be transformed to real data in a few different ways to fit the traditional machine learning framework. In this research, we compare the performance of two such ways - combining real and imaginary components or stacking them - on a simple neural network. To compare these two methods, we create magnitude (combined) and rectangular (stacked) spectrograms from artificial time-series data. Then, we feed the raw 1D time-series dataset, 2D magnitude spectrogram dataset, and 3D rectangular spectrogram dataset to a neural network for training and validation. As a measure of performance, we track the accuracy of each dataset model. From our experimentation, we found out that the rectangular dataset outperforms the magnitude spectrogram in most cases.},

The first characteristic is the absence of historical fault data. The second characteristic is that the machine is in a constant state of transient operation. An example of such a machine is the swing machinery of an electromechanical excavator. The monitoring strategy presented here employs an anomaly detection scheme together with various methods of signal processing and feature extraction. Experiments are carried out using a laboratory apparatus to show the how various configurations of the system are able to detect different types of faults.

  abstract = {Rolling element bearing is the most frequently failed component in rotary machine. Its failure could cause unexpected machine breakdown. This paper presents a novel fault diagnostic method called sparsogram that can enable early bearing fault detection in a prompt manner. The main concept of sparsogram is derived from the sparsity measurement commonly used for analyzing ultrasonic signals. Sparsogram is capable of detecting high resonant frequency bands that magnify the bearing faulty signals. By using sparsogram, the fault related resonant frequency bands can be determined and used to reveal the temporal waveform contained in each band. Envelope analysis is then applied to convert faulty signals from high frequency band to low frequency band. Finally, power spectrum is employed to display these low frequency signals at their respective frequency spectrum. From the spectrum, the bearing characteristic frequencies related to different types of faults can be easily can be detected and identified. To verify the effectiveness of sparsogram, three different types of simulated signal and a real bearing faulty signal collected from industrial machine were tested. The results show that the sparsogram has good abilities in detecting the health status of bearings, and if faults occurred, determining the causes of faults.},

One solution is to process the data at the edge devices themselves, in order to alleviate cloud server workloads and improve latency. However, edge devices are less powerful than cloud servers, and many are subject to energy constraints. Hence, new resource and energy-oriented deep learning models are required, as well as new computing platforms.

CNNs achieve better results at the cost of higher computing and memory requirements. Inference of convolutional neural networks is therefore usually done in centralized high-performance platforms. However, many applications based on CNNs are migrating to edge devices near the source of data due to the unreliability of a transmission channel in exchanging data with a central server, the uncertainty about channel latency not tolerated by many applications, security and data privacy, etc. While advantageous, deep learning on edge is quite challenging because edge devices are usually limited in terms of performance, cost, and energy. Reconfigurable computing is being considered for inference on edge due to its high performance and energy efficiency while keeping a high hardware flexibility that allows for the easy adaption of the target computing platform to the CNN model. In this paper, we described the features of the most common CNNs, the capabilities of reconfigurable computing for running CNNs, the state-of-the-art of reconfigurable computing implementations proposed to run CNN models, as well as the trends and challenges for future edge reconfigurable platforms.},

We seek to understand the empirical success of this approach from a theoretical perspective. We formulate the augmentation process as a latent variable model by postulating a partition of the latent representation into a content component, which is assumed invariant to augmentation, and a style component, which is allowed to change. Unlike prior work on disentanglement and independent component analysis, we allow for both nontrivial statistical and causal dependencies in the latent space. We study the identifiability of the latent representation based on pairs of views of the observations and prove sufficient conditions that allow us to identify the invariant content partition up to an invertible mapping in both generative and discriminative settings. We find numerical simulations with dependent latent variables are consistent with our theory. Lastly, we introduce Causal3DIdent, a dataset of high-dimensional, visually complex images with rich causal dependencies, which we use to study the effect of data augmentations performed in practice.},

  abstract = {Recently, deep generative models have become increasingly popular in unsupervised anomaly detection. However, deep generative models aim at recovering the data distribution rather than detecting anomalies. Moreover, deep generative models have the risk of overfitting training samples, which has disastrous effects on anomaly detection performance. To solve the above two problems, we propose a self-adversarial variational autoencoder (adVAE) with a Gaussian anomaly prior assumption. We assume that both the anomalous and the normal prior distribution are Gaussian and have overlaps in the latent space. Therefore, a Gaussian transformer net T is trained to synthesize anomalous but near-normal latent variables. Keeping the original training objective of a variational autoencoder, a generator G tries to distinguish between the normal latent variables encoded by E and the anomalous latent variables synthesized by T, and the encoder E is trained to discriminate whether the output of G is real. These new objectives we added not only give both G and E the ability to discriminate, but also become an additional regularization mechanism to prevent overfitting. Compared with other competitive methods, the proposed model achieves significant improvements in extensive experiments. The employed datasets and our model are available in a Github repository.},

Nevertheless, the physical interpretation of neural networks is still on-going and not fully explored. This paper aims to design a fully interpretable neural network for machine condition monitoring from the aspects of signal processing and physical feature extraction. The main idea of the fully interpretable neural network is to extend the un\- interpretable structure of extreme learning machine (ELM) to an interpretable structure for ma\- chine condition monitoring. From the aspect of signal processing, wavelet transform, square envelope and Fourier transform are incorporated into the input layer of the original ELM to extract repetitive transients, localize informative frequency bands for an enhancement of a signalto-noise ratio, and realize square envelope spectra for exhibiting cyclo-stationarity of repetitive transients. Hence, the first to four layers of the proposed network are physically interpretable. From the aspect of physical feature extraction, popular sparsity measures are innovatively incorporated into all random nodes in the single-hidden layer of the original ELM to interpret the use of all hidden nodes in the fifth layer of the proposed network to characterize cyclo-stationarity of repetitive transients. The significance of this paper is to show that signal processing algorithms and physical feature extraction can be reformulated as the architecture of an interpretable neural network to automatically localize informative frequency bands for machine condition monitoring. This paper attempts to inspire researchers in the field of signal processing and machine learning to think about the design of more advanced interpretable neural networks for machine condition monitoring.},

Correlations between residuals are identified as a source of misclassifications, and whitening transformations that decorrelate input features and/or residuals are analyzed as a potential solution. For two use cases, regarding spatially distributed wind power generation and temporal profiles of electricity consumption, the performance of various data processing combinations was quantified. Whitening of the input data was found to be most beneficial for accurate detection, with a slight benefit for the combined whitening of inputs and residuals. For localization of anomalies, whitening of residuals was preferred, and the best performance was obtained using standardization of the input data and whitening of the residuals using the zero-phase component analysis (ZCA) or zero-phase component analysis-correlation (ZCA-cor) whitening matrix with a small additional offset.},

  abstract = {Data-driven fault diagnosis methods often require abundant labeled examples for each fault type. On the contrary, real-world data is often unlabeled and consists of mostly healthy observations and only few samples of faulty conditions. The lack of labels and fault samples imposes a significant challenge for existing data-driven fault diagnosis methods. In this article, we aim to overcome this limitation by integrating expert knowledge with domain adaptation (DA) in a synthetic-to-real framework for unsupervised fault diagnosis. Motivated by the fact that domain experts often have a relatively good understanding on how different fault types affect healthy signals, in the first step of the proposed framework, a synthetic fault dataset is generated by augmenting real vibration samples of healthy bearings.

On the contrary, real-world data is often unlabeled and consists of mostly healthy observations and only few samples of faulty conditions. The lack of labels and fault samples imposes a significant challenge for existing data-driven fault diagnosis methods.

Prevalent mechanical life prediction techniques encounter challenges arising from the lack of model transparency and limited interpretability, which can undermine confidence in the reliability and accuracy of forecasted outcomes. To provide a fresh perspective for comprehending the behavior of complex systems and enhancing the robustness of prediction accuracy, a novel approach called Koopman-Informed Neural Network (KINN) is proposed. This innovative approach adeptly captures complex data patterns and relationships via nonlinear transformations by amalgamating Koopman theory with neural networks. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on linear approximations or local analyses, the Koopman operator framework enables a global linear representation of a system's dynamics by lifting the state space to a higher-dimensional eigenfunction space. This method employs both forward and backward Koopman dynamic operators to capture and reconstruct the system's temporal dynamics, with physical constraints helping to regularize system behaviors and ensure stability. Experimental assessments were conducted using both a synthetic N-CMAPSS dataset and a real-world bearing full-life dataset, revealing the robustness and generalization capabilities of the proposed methodology, leading to improvements in the accuracy of RUL prediction.},

The sounds emitted by different types of machines often have different characteristics, and the environments in which the machines work (such as temperature, noise, etc.) are constantly changing, which also affects the acoustic characteristics of the machine sound, so this is a challenging task. To this end, we propose a method for anomalous sound detection based on self-supervised classification. First, we obtain an effective feature representation of the sound by extracting frequency domain and time domain features from the raw wave and extracting pre-trained features based on the pre-trained model. Then, we design an auxiliary loss based on the attribute information of the audio, which helps the model to distinguish different operating conditions of the machine. Finally, we extract latent representations from the trained model, and calculate the anomaly score of the machine based on the distance metric. Experimental results on the DCASE 2022 Challenge Task 2 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we analyze the complementarity between different feature representations, which proves that the feature representations used in our method are effective.},

The intricate structure of a planetary gearbox will fail traditional bearing fault diagnosis algorithms by bringing in strong and complex planetary gear noise. In specific, planetary gear noise with multi-sidebands and high magnitude will not only fail the former gear noise elimination algorithms but also affect the methods designed for highlighting bearing-fault-related content. As such, we propose a new approach with four main steps to address this issue: a) calculate the spectral kurtosis (SK) matrix of a healthy planetary gearbox as baseline, b) obtain SKRgram (Spectral kurtosis ratio gram) by calculating the ratio between SK matrix of raw signal and the baseline, c) locate potential filtering areas from the SKRgram using SKR value as criterion and then select potential optimal filter bands among them with the standard of kurtosis value, d) highlight the faulty planet bearing content by filtering the raw signal through potential filter bands and identify the fault type of planet bearing by comparing the filtered results with the fault envelope pattern. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed planet bearing fault detection algorithm are verified by both the simulated and experimental data.},

  abstract = {Thanks to the great efforts made by Antoni (2006), spectral kurtosis has been recognized as a milestone for characterizing non-stationary signals, especially bearing fault signals. The main idea of spectral kurtosis is to use the fourth standardized moment, namely kurtosis, as a function of spectral frequency so as to indicate how repetitive transients caused by a bearing defect vary with frequency. Moreover, spectral kurtosis is defined based on an analytic bearing fault signal constructed from either a complex filter or Hilbert transform. On the other hand, another attractive work was reported by Borghesani et al. (2014) to mathematically reveal the relationship between the kurtosis of an analytical bearing fault signal and the square of the squared envelope spectrum of the analytical bearing fault signal for explaining spectral correlation for quantification of bearing fault signals. More interestingly, it was discovered that the sum of peaks at cyclic frequencies in the square of the squared envelope spectrum corresponds to the raw 4th order moment. Inspired by the aforementioned works, in this paper, we mathematically show that: (1) spectral kurtosis can be decomposed into squared envelope and squared L2/L1 norm so that spectral kurtosis can be explained as spectral squared L2/L1 norm; (2) spectral L2/L1 norm is formally defined for characterizing bearing fault signals and its two geometrical explanations are made; (3) spectral L2/L1 norm is proportional to the square root of the sum of peaks at cyclic frequencies in the square of the squared envelope spectrum; (4) some extensions of spectral L2/L1 norm for characterizing bearing fault signals are pointed out.},

In general, machine and deep learning are employed as discriminative models within a supervised setting. Progress in unsupervised generative modelling allows for generative models to be employed in discriminative (discrete classes) and deviation (continuous deviation from a baseline) tasks. This only requires the samples to be chronological. Discriminative and deviation analysis is usually based on the reconstruction loss. However, this is limited as it offers only a single scalar from which inference can be made. Generative models do, however, learn a latent representation of the data from which additional scalars can be derived. Whether these derived scalars are informative depends on the quality of the latent representations. Most learning algorithms derive a latent representation that efficiently explains the variance in the data, which can be informative when the property of interest is well explained by variance. Alternatively, a lesser known class of learning algorithms aim to learn a latent representation that aims to identify sources in the data. Hence, given the same data, an infinite number of latent representations are possible, of which only a fraction are informative. We consider three classes of latent spaces that are stochastic, entangled and untangled. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of untangled latent spaces to obtain informative signals for condition monitoring.},

  abstract = {State-of-the-art anomalous sound detection systems often utilize angular margin losses to learn suitable representations of acoustic data using an auxiliary task, which usually is a supervised or self-supervised classification task. The underlying idea is that, in order to solve this auxiliary task, specific information about normal data needs to be captured in the learned representations and that this information is also sufficient to differentiate between normal and anomalous samples. Especially in noisy conditions, discriminative models based on angular margin losses tend to significantly outperform systems based on generative or one-class models. The goal of this work is to investigate why using angular margin losses with auxiliary tasks works well for detecting anomalous sounds. To this end, it is shown, both theoretically and experimentally, that minimizing angular margin losses also minimizes compactness loss while inherently preventing learning trivial solutions. Furthermore, multiple experiments are conducted to show that using a related classification task as an auxiliary task teaches the model to learn representations suitable for detecting anomalous sounds in noisy conditions. Among these experiments are performance evaluations, visualizing the embedding space with t-SNE and visualizing the input representations with respect to the anomaly score using randomized input sampling for explanation.},

We propose to use Nonnegative Matrix Factorization of spectrogram for separation of cyclic and non-cyclic impulsive components. Partial information is fused into a single data set for each component. Finally, post-processing is implemented to allow to recover the time series of each component.

  abstract = {Gaussian classifiers are strongly dependent on their underlying distance method, namely the Mahalanobis distance. Even though widely used, in the presence of noise this distance measure loses dramatically in performance, due to equal summation of the squared distances over all features. The features with large distance can mask all the other features so that the classification considers only these features, neglecting the information provided by the other features. To overcome this drawback we propose to weight the different features in the Mahalanobis distance according to their distances after the variance normalization. The idea behind this is to give less weight to noisy features and high weight to noise free features which are more reliable. Thereafter, we replace the traditional distance measure in a Gaussian classifier with the proposed. In a series of experiments we show the improved noise robustness of Gaussian classifiers by the proposed modifications in contrast to the traditional approach.},

Second method is formed by utilizing the ratio of two types of risks for each type of error event. The two methods proposed generate adjusted and optimized S (detection threshold) values under given conditions and depending on the expectation of costs for error events. The results show that the methods suggest adjusted S values in terms of the risk and the costbenefit based on the error values. For instance, the Type-II error event is more forbidden for the system that treats more special nuclear materials (e.g. Pu) during a short period. Moreover, the long-time period without inspection could enhance opportunities for the Type-II error event occurring.

In this paper, we discover that, weight decay can unfortunately lead to large gradient norms at the final phase (or the terminated solution) of training, which often indicates bad convergence and poor generalization. To mitigate the gradient-norm-centered pitfalls, we present the first practical scheduler for weight decay, called the Scheduled Weight Decay (SWD) method that can dynamically adjust the weight decay strength according to the gradient norm and significantly penalize large gradient norms during training. Our experiments also support that SWD indeed mitigates large gradient norms and often significantly outperforms the conventional constant weight decay strategy for Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam).},

However, most of the existing CNN models cannot favorably handle the data generated in variable-speed scenarios. First, the continuous irregular fluctuation of the motor makes the time domain interval between two adjacent fault pulses change continuously. Secondly, due to the complex transmission path of the signal under unstable conditions, the noise distribution is complex. To address this problem, a global contextual residual convolutional neural network is proposed. The major novelties fall into three aspects. First, to make full use of the features from all intermediate layers and explore multiscale information, a new hierarchical structure is adopted in the CNN model. Second, since different features are of different importance for fault detection tasks, the global context module is explored to guide the model to pay more attention to global discriminant features. Third, the features learned by the network can either promote each other or contradict each other, so a multi-feature fusion layer is introduced to integrate these features adaptively. Case studies using the benchmark motor dataset and the industrial motor bearing dataset are performed to validate the superiority of the GC-ResCNN.},

  abstract = {We study how neural networks trained by gradient descent extrapolate, i.e., what they learn outside the support of the training distribution. Previous works report mixed empirical results when extrapolating with neural networks: while feedforward neural networks, a.k.a. multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), do not extrapolate well in certain simple tasks, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) -- structured networks with MLP modules -- have shown some success in more complex tasks. Working towards a theoretical explanation, we identify conditions under which MLPs and GNNs extrapolate well. First, we quantify the observation that ReLU MLPs quickly converge to linear functions along any direction from the origin, which implies that ReLU MLPs do not extrapolate most nonlinear functions. But, they can provably learn a linear target function when the training distribution is sufficiently ``diverse''. Second, in connection to analyzing the successes and limitations of GNNs, these results suggest a hypothesis for which we provide theoretical and empirical evidence: the success of GNNs in extrapolating algorithmic tasks to new data (e.g., larger graphs or edge weights) relies on encoding task-specific non-linearities in the architecture or features. Our theoretical analysis builds on a connection of over-parameterized networks to the neural tangent kernel. Empirically, our theory holds across different training settings.},

Applying this classifier in standard training on clean data is sufficient to ensure the high accuracy and good robustness of the model.

  abstract = {Rolling bearings are critical and easily damaged components of mechanical equipment. In practical engineering applications, the collected signals typically contain a large amount of noise, which makes fault diagnosis difficult. Based on this, this paper proposes an adaptive time--frequency demodulation method for rolling bearing diagnosis. The proposed method first obtains the complex envelope of the vibration signal in the time--frequency domain using the S transform (ST), and the time--frequency coefficient of ST can be used as the complex envelope, which is proved in detail in this paper. Subsequently, the complex envelope of the optimal slice frequency is obtained by frequency slicing to significantly weaken the interference of irrelevant noise and highlight the fault characteristics. An indicator is proposed to adaptively select an optimal slice frequency component that contains the most fault information. Finally, the slice envelope spectrum of the optimal slice frequency is obtained using Fourier transform for fault diagnosis. The feasibility of the proposed method is verified using the simulated signal. The application results of the bearing inner and outer ring fault experimental signals indicate that the proposed method is more accurate and effective for bearing fault diagnosis. Comparisons with other commonly used methods also verified the superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Process monitoring is a critical activity in manufacturing industries. A wide variety of data-driven approaches have been developed and employed for fault detection and fault diagnosis. Analyzing the existing process monitoring schemes, prediction accuracy of the process status is usually the primary focus while the explanation (diagnosis) of a detected fault is relegated to a secondary role. In this paper, an interpretable unsupervised machine learning model based on Bayesian Networks (BN) is proposed to be the fundamental model supporting the process monitoring scheme. The proposed methodology is aligned with the recent efforts of eXplanatory Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for knowledge induction and decision making, now brought to the scope of advanced process monitoring. A BN is capable of combining data-driven induction with existing domain knowledge about the process and to display the underlying causal interactions of a process system in an easily interpretable graphical form. The proposed fault detection scheme consists of two levels of monitoring. In the first level, a global index is computed and monitored to detect any deviation from normal operation conditions. In the second level, two local indices are proposed to examine the fine structure of the fault, once it is signaled at the first level. These local indices support the diagnosis of the fault, and are based on the individual unconditional and conditional distributions of the monitored variables. A new labeling procedure is also proposed to narrow down the search and identify the fault type. Unlike many existing diagnosis methods that require access to faulty data (supervised diagnosis methods), the proposed diagnosis methodology belongs to the class that only requires data under normal conditions (unsupervised diagnosis methods). The effectiveness of the proposed monitoring scheme is demonstrated and validated through simulated datasets and an industrial dataset from semiconductor manufacturing.},

  abstract = {Recently, deep learning approaches with various network architectures have achieved significant performance improvement over existing iterative reconstruction methods in various imaging problems. However, it is still unclear why these deep learning architectures work for specific inverse problems. Moreover, in contrast to the usual evolution of signal processing theory around the classical theories, the link between deep learning and the classical signal processing approaches such as wavelets, non-local processing, compressed sensing, etc, are not yet well understood. To address these issues, here we show that the long-searched-for missing link is the convolution framelets for representing a signal by convolving local and non-local bases. The convolution framelets was originally developed to generalize the theory of low-rank Hankel matrix approaches for inverse problems, and this paper further extends the idea so that we can obtain a deep neural network using multilayer convolution framelets with perfect reconstruction (PR) under rectilinear linear unit nonlinearity (ReLU). Our analysis also shows that the popular deep network components such as residual block, redundant filter channels, and concatenated ReLU (CReLU) do indeed help to achieve the PR, while the pooling and unpooling layers should be augmented with high-pass branches to meet the PR condition. Moreover, by changing the number of filter channels and bias, we can control the shrinkage behaviors of the neural network. This discovery reveals the limitations of many existing deep learning architectures for inverse problems, and leads us to propose a novel theory for deep convolutional framelets neural network. Using numerical experiments with various inverse problems, we demonstrated that our deep convolution framelets network shows consistent improvement over existing deep architectures. This discovery suggests that the success of deep learning is not from a magical power of a black-box, but rather comes from the power of a novel signal representation using non-local basis combined with data-driven local basis, which is indeed a natural extension of classical signal processing theory.},

To leverage both machine learning (ML) methods and classical traffic flow models, the previous study has developed a hybrid framework for encoding traffic flow into multivariant Gaussian Process. However, the computational efficiency is low due to multiple inputs, outputs and equations. To improve the efficiency of the previous method, this paper presents a new modeling framework, named gradual physics regularized learning, to incrementally encode complex traffic flow models into the ML process. More specifically, the method starts with the involvement of traffic flow models from the lower-order version, such as the fundamental diagram and the kinetic wave models. Then the learned parameters and hyperparameters can be further fine-tuned with the high-order models. A field test based on real-world freeway measurements indicates the proposed model can leverage the additional physical equations to achieve better performance in estimation accuracy and robustness. Meanwhile, the gradual learning method can significantly reduce the computational efforts and further enables its application to scenarios with either larger datasets or more complex traffic flow models.},

  abstract = {The steel-spring vibration isolators (SVIs) are critical components of the floating-slab track (FST) in metro system, aiming at ensuring a good performance regarding vibration attenuation. Su\- pervised learning-based models have been recently developed for the SVI damage detection. As they are mostly trained on simulation datasets, the damage detection performance of these models is greatly spoiled on real-life datasets due to the so-called domain shift issue. In this study, a multi-strategy-based domain adaptation methodology is proposed for cross-domain SVI damage detection and localization, where domain adversarial training and feature distribution discrep\- ancy regularization are adopted. The core of the proposed procedure is to extract damagesensitive and domain-invariant features from the dynamic responses of the track system. The main advantage is that only the source domain dataset needs to be well-labeled while label in\- formation of recorded acceleration response related to the real structure is not required for model training. Vehicle-slab track coupled dynamic simulations are conducted to build the labeled source dataset, allowing for different operational scenarios and SVI health conditions. Then, modeling uncertainties are introduced concerning model parameters, and background noise is added to the computed responses to mimic real engineering scenarios in the target domain datasets. A noteworthy good detection performance is reported, when the trained network is finally tested on the target dataset. Ablation studies and feature visualization are then reported, to get insights into the reasons why the proposed method proves superior to a traditional CNN and other domain adaption methods. Finally, an experimental dataset collected during field tests is exploited to validate the effectiveness of the proposed domain adaptation method.},

Orthogonal projection is useful to capture the null subspace that consists of noisy information for AD, which is explicitly ignored in the existing approaches. The exploration of double subspaces, called normal space (NS) and abnormal space (AS) can improve the discriminative manifold information. Therefore, in this study, autoencoder framework based on the OPC learning method is proposed that combines the orthogonal subspace score and the reconstruction error score in the target tasks for AD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that introduces an autoencoder-based model with two orthogonal subspaces for AD. Through the orthogonality, the anomaly-free data and abnormalnnosiy information are projected into the NS and the AS, respectively. Thus, it potentially addresses the problem of the distribution of generative model by combining the abilities of two subspaces that can appropriately learn the features and establish a strict boundaries around the normal data. For image datasets, we propose a convolutional autoencoder based on OPC. Additionally, the generalization and adaptability of the proposed method in AD was investigated using vector datasets by implementing a fully-connected layer-based OPC in the encoder-decoder structure. The effectiveness of the proposed framework for AD was evaluated through the comparison with state-of-the-art approaches.},

A semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach can be employed to increase the identification performance of the classifiers under such situation. In this study, a three-stage SSL approach using data augmentation (DA) and metric learning is proposed for an intelligent bearing fault diagnosis under limited labeled data. In the first stage, a DA method comprising seven DA strategies is presented to expand the feature space for the limited labeled samples under each healthy conditions. An optimization objective combining a cross entropy loss and a triplet loss is adopted to enlarge the margin between the feature distributions of limited labeled samples under different healthy conditions. In the second stage, a K-means technique is employed to acquire the cluster centers for the limited labeled samples under different healthy conditions. In the third stage, the label information for the unlabeled samples is first estimated according to the membership between the feature distributions of the unlabeled samples and the various cluster centers for original labeled samples and then a Kullback-Leibler divergence loss is introduced to minimize the discrepancy between feature distributions for the unlabeled samples and its corresponding cluster centers. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on two case studies, one is on an experimental bearing fault dataset from our laboratory test-rig, and the other is on a publicly dataset from a bearing degradation test. The comparison results on these two case studies demonstrate that the proposed method can perform better in bearing fault diagnosis under limited labeled samples than existing diagnostic methods.},

  abstract = {Self-supervised learning (SSL) is rapidly closing the gap with supervised methods on large computer vision benchmarks. A successful approach to SSL is to learn embeddings which are invariant to distortions of the input sample. However, a recurring issue with this approach is the existence of trivial constant solutions. Most current methods avoid such solutions by careful implementation details. We propose an objective function that naturally avoids collapse by measuring the cross-correlation matrix between the outputs of two identical networks fed with distorted versions of a sample, and making it as close to the identity matrix as possible. This causes the embedding vectors of distorted versions of a sample to be similar, while minimizing the redundancy between the components of these vectors. The method is called Barlow Twins, owing to neuroscientist H. Barlow's redundancy-reduction principle applied to a pair of identical networks. Barlow Twins does not require large batches nor asymmetry between the network twins such as a predictor network, gradient stopping, or a moving average on the weight updates. Intriguingly it benefits from very high-dimensional output vectors. Barlow Twins outperforms previous methods on ImageNet for semi-supervised classification in the low-data regime, and is on par with current state of the art for ImageNet classification with a linear classifier head, and for transfer tasks of classification and object detection.},

While researchers develop more and more complex machine learning (ML) models to predict the remaining useful life (RUL), most models are not designed with regard to actual industrial practice and are not validated with industrial data. To overcome this gap between research and industry and to create added value, we propose a holistic framework that aims at directly integrating PdM models with production scheduling. To enable PdM-integrated production scheduling (PdM-IPS), an operation-specific health prognostics model is required. Therefore, we propose a generative deep learning model based on the conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) that can derive an operation-specific health indicator (HI) from large-scale industrial condition monitoring (CM) data. We choose this unsupervised learning approach to cope with one of the biggest challenges of applying PdM in industry: the lack of labelled failure data. The health prognostics model provides a quantitative measure of degradation given a specific production sequence and thus enables PdM-IPS. The framework is validated both on NASA's C-MAPSS data set as well as real industrial data from machining centers for automotive component manufacturing. The results indicate that the approach can both capture and quantify changes in machine condition such that PdM-IPS can be subsequently realized.},

  abstract = {Fault detection has been extensively studied in both academia and industry. The rareness of faulty samples in the real world restricts the use of many supervised models, and the reliance on domain expertise for feature engineering raises other barriers. For this reason, this paper proposes an unsupervised, end-to-end approach to fault detection based on a flow-based model, the Nonlinear Independent Components Estimation (NICE) model. A NICE model models a target distribution via a sequence of invertible transformations to a prior distribution in the latent space. We prove that, under certain conditions, the L2-norm of normal samples' latent codes in a trained NICE model is Chi-distributed. This facilitates the use of hypothesis testing for fault detection purpose. Concretely, we first apply Zero-phase Component Analysis to decorrelate the data of normal states. The whitened data are fed to a NICE model for training, in a maximum likelihood sense. At the testing stage, samples whose L2-norm of latent codes fail in the hypothesis testing are suspected of being generated by different mechanisms and hence regarded as potential faults. The proposed approach was validated on two datasets of vibration signals; it proved superior to several alternatives. We also show the use of NICE, a type of generative model, can produce real-like vibration signals because of the model's bijective nature.},

  abstract = {The concept of deep transfer learning has spawned broad research into fault diagnosis with small samples. A considerable covariate shift between the source and target domains, however, could result in negative transfer and lower fault diagnosis task accuracy. To alleviate the adverse impacts of negative transfer, this research proposes an intra-domain transfer learning strategy that makes use of knowledge from a data-abundant source domain that is akin to the target domain. Concretely, a pre-trained model in the source domain is built via a vanilla transfer from an offthe-shelf inter-domain deep neural network. The model is then transferred to the target domain using shallow-layer freezing and finetuning with those small samples. In a case study involving rotating machinery, where we tested the proposed strategy, we saw improved performance in both training efficiency and prediction accuracy. To demystify the learned neural network, we propose a heat map visualization method using a channel-wise average over the final convolutional layer and up-sampling with interpolation. The findings revealed that the most active neurons coincide with the corresponding fault characteristics.},

  abstract = {In practical engineering applications, the multivariate signal contains more fault feature information than the single-channel signal. How to realize synchronous extraction of fault features from the multivariate signal is of great significance in fault diagnosis of rotary machinery. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has attracted much attention due to its excellent dynamic feature extraction ability. However, DMD lacks mode aliasing property when dealing with the multivariate signal, which may lead to the loss of critical fault feature information. Cater to this problem, this article proposed a multivariate DMD (MDMD) algorithm that is the multivariate extension of DMD. First, snapshot tensors are defined to convert multivariate signals to tensor format. Then, the MDMD algorithm is proposed by introducing tensor operations into the original DMD algorithm, where a tensor low tubal rank component extraction framework is constructed to enable simultaneous extraction of bearing fault features from the multivariate signal, to enhance the robustness and effectiveness of the algorithm. Finally, both numerical simulations and experiments verify that the proposed MDMD has higher fault diagnosis accuracy than other multivariate signal-processing methods.},

  abstract = {Intelligent fault diagnosis techniques have replaced time-consuming and unreliable human analysis, increasing the efficiency of fault diagnosis. Deep learning models can improve the accuracy of intelligent fault diagnosis with the help of their multilayer nonlinear mapping ability. This paper proposes a novel method named Deep Convolutional Neural Networks with Wide First-layer Kernels (WDCNN). The proposed method uses raw vibration signals as input (data augmentation is used to generate more inputs), and uses the wide kernels in the first convolutional layer for extracting features and suppressing high frequency noise. Small convolutional kernels in the preceding layers are used for multilayer nonlinear mapping. AdaBN is implemented to improve the domain adaptation ability of the model. The proposed model addresses the problem that currently, the accuracy of CNN applied to fault diagnosis is not very high. WDCNN can not only achieve 100\% classification accuracy on normal signals, but also outperform the state-of-the-art DNN model which is based on frequency features under different working load and noisy environment conditions.},

  abstract = {Rotating machinery intelligent diagnosis based on deep learning (DL) has gone through tremendous progress, which can help reduce costly breakdowns. However, different datasets and hyper-parameters are recommended to be used, and few open source codes are publicly available, resulting in unfair comparisons and ineffective improvement. To address these issues, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of four models, including multi-layer perception (MLP), autoencoder (AE), convolutional neural network (CNN), and recurrent neural network (RNN), with seven datasets to provide a benchmark study. We first gather nine publicly available datasets and give a comprehensive benchmark study of DL-based models with two data split strategies, five input formats, three normalization methods, and four augmentation methods. Second, we integrate the whole evaluation codes into a code library and release it to the public for better comparisons. Third, we use specific-designed cases to point out the existing issues, including class imbalance, generalization ability, interpretability, few-shot learning, and model selection. Finally, we release a unified code framework for comparing and testing models fairly and quickly, emphasize the importance of open source codes, provide the baseline accuracy (a lower bound), and discuss existing issues in this field.

  abstract = {The Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) has been a staple of signal processing, often being the first step for many audio tasks. A very familiar process when using the STFT is the search for the best STFT parameters, as they often have significant side effects if chosen poorly. These parameters are often defined in terms of an integer number of samples, which makes their optimization non-trivial. In this paper we show an approach that allows us to obtain a gradient for STFT parameters with respect to arbitrary cost functions, and thus enable the ability to employ gradient descent optimization of quantities like the STFT window length, or the STFT hop size. We do so for parameter values that stay constant throughout an input, but also for cases where these parameters have to dynamically change over time to accommodate varying signal characteristics.},

  abstract = {Conventional deep learning trained with labeled data has made remarkable achievements in the field of mechanical fault diagnosis. Nevertheless, in practical industrial applications, it is hard to obtain enough, identically distributed, and well-labeled monitoring data for training a well-generalized network. To relax these restrictions on training data, this article proposes a new domain adaptation fault diagnosis method that fuses cycle-consistent adversarial (CCA) learning and multiple kernel variant of the maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) distance measure algorithm. The CCA learning intends to align distributions in the generation space. MK-MMD metric in domain-shared module closes across-domain distances by learning invariant features in high-level embedded spaces. To facilitate the reconstructed samples with smaller intraclass distance and greater interclass distance, the proposed method adopts a new training strategy, that is, the CCA module is no longer trained independently, but trained jointly with the domain-shared module and classifier. To reduce consumption in making datasets, bearing vibration signals collected by acceleration sensors are directly used after being standardized and segmented. It is demonstrated that the fusion improves the aggregation of reconstructed samples and promotes positive transfer across domains. The comparison with other transfer learning methods verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method and shows its superiority in diagnostic performance.},

  abstract = {Advancements in digital automation for smart grids have led to the installation of measurement devices like phasor measurement units (PMUs), micro-PMUs ({\textmu}-PMUs), and smart meters. However, large amount of data collected by these devices bring several challenges as control room operators need to use this data with models to make confident decisions for reliable and resilient operation of the cyber-power systems. Machine-learning (ML) based tools can provide a reliable interpretation of the deluge of data obtained from the field. For the decision-makers to ensure reliable network operation under all operating conditions, these tools need to identify solutions that are feasible and satisfy the system constraints, while being efficient, trustworthy and interpretable. This resulted in the increasing popularity of physics-informed machine learning (PIML) approaches, as these methods overcome challenges that model-based or datadriven ML methods face in silos. This work aims at the following: a) review existing strategies and techniques for incorporating underlying physical principles of the power grid into different types of ML approaches (supervised/semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning (RL)); b) explore the existing works on PIML methods for anomaly detection, classification, localization, and mitigation in power transmission and distribution systems, c) discuss improvements in existing methods through consideration of potential challenges while also addressing the limitations to make them suitable for realworld applications.},
